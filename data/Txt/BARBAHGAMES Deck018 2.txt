BARBAH GAMES
TOKENIZING GAMING 
FOR REAL-WORLD 
CAREERS IN WEB3
Only 6 players out of 
the 200 million gamers
in Africa participated 
in the 2023 Gamers8 
event .
Africa boasts
a vibrant gaming community of
over 200 million, yet these passionate players
lack clear pathways to success in the global
Esports industry
.
Their skills gap leaves them vulnerable to the
disruptions of the AI
-driven job market, and
further hampered by outdated education
systems
.
How can we empower this vast potential
and propel African gamers to thrive in
the digital age?
Esports is more than 
just gaming.
We equip you to unlock 
a world of endless 
possibilities and 
opportunites 
At BARBAH Games, we believe that the
immersive and digital nature of esports can
play a significant role in empowering
individuals to acquire the skills needed for the
evolving job market.
We believe EDU-TAINMENT can bridge the
gap, between what current education
provides and what future jobs will require.
Who doesn't want to build a career doing
what they love most?
