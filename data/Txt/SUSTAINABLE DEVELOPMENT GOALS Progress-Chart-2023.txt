SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
Progress Chart 2023
© UNDP Timor-Leste/Yuichi Ishida
The Sustainable Development Goals Progress Chart 2023 presents a comprehensive overview of global 
progress with respect to the targets outlined in the 17 Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
The Progress Chart 2023 serves as a companion to The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023: 
Special Edition.
The progress chart provides a trend assessment, employing a visual framework of stoplight colours to measure 
progress towards each target using trend data between the baseline year of 2015 and the most recent year.
Among the 169 targets, 138 can be assessed based on both available global data and analysis conducted by 
custodian agencies, while 31 targets lack sucient data or additional analysis for the trend assessment.
A midpoint evaluation of SDG progress on the journey to 2030 reveals significant challenges. Insight derived 
from the latest global-level data and custodian agencies analysis paints a concerning picture. Among the 
assessable targets, a mere 15 per cent are on track to be achieved by 2030. Nearly half—48 per cent—of the 
targets that can be assessed show moderate or severe deviations from the desired trajectory. Furthermore, over 
one-third—37 per cent—of these targets have experienced no progress or, even worse, have regressed below the 
2015 baseline. This comprehensive assessment underscores the urgent need for intensified eorts to ensure the 
Sustainable Development Goals stay on course.
