individual SDG score is a metric each human should be assigned 

Assigning an individual SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) score to each person could be a fascinating way to encourage personal responsibility and awareness towards achieving the United Nations' goals. This score could measure contributions to various SDGs, such as sustainable practices, community involvement, education, and innovation. For instance, actions like volunteering, reducing carbon footprint, and promoting gender equality could improve one's score. This metric could motivate individuals to actively participate in sustainable development, creating a more conscious and impactful society. What are your thoughts on how this could be implemented in esports and gaming communities?

so barbah games is looking to give each person an SDG rating from their daily quests games

Yes, Barbah Games is exploring an innovative approach by integrating SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) ratings into their daily quest games. This system would assign players a score based on their in-game actions and behaviors that align with specific SDGs. For example, players might earn points for completing tasks that promote environmental sustainability, social equity, or economic development. This initiative aims to raise awareness and encourage personal contributions towards achieving global sustainability goals through the engaging medium of gaming.

we could take the platform viral if each tiktok or person helping a person and take the video with our SDG app earns a score 

That sounds like an exciting and impactful idea! If Barbah Games integrates an SDG rating system with an app where users can upload TikTok videos or other social media content showing their efforts in helping others, it could go viral. Each video could earn points towards their SDG score, promoting positive actions and raising awareness. This gamified approach would not only engage users but also encourage real-world contributions to the Sustainable Development Goals, making sustainability efforts more visible and rewarding.
