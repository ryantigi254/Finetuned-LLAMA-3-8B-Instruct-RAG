 Driving Engagement by gamifying SDG Quests 
At BARBAH Games, we are committed to more than just gaming; we are dedicated to making a positive impact on our world through the power of play. Our initiative, the SDG Daily Quest, is designed to blend the excitement of gaming with the important mission of educating and engaging our community on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The SDG Daily Quest: A Year-Long Journey of Discovery and Impact
Each day, members of the BARBAH Games community embark on unique quests. These daily quests are more than simple tasks; they are opportunities for our gamers to explore and document real-world examples of the SDGs in action, building up excitement to the weekend's SDG tournament. Whether it’s capturing a photo of a local education initiative for SDG 4 (Quality Education) or a community recycling program for SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), each quest encourages our gamers to see the world through the lens of sustainable development.
Continuous Engagement and Point Accumulation
As gamers complete their daily quests, they document their findings with photos. We want the images taken with apps that include point cloud data where possible and we will have the images geolocation tags via What3Words.  This innovative approach not only helps in verifying the quests but also contributes to creating a digital twin of the locations for reporting, fostering a deeper understanding of the impact areas.
Every completed quest earns points, and these points accumulate throughout the year. This gamified system ensures that our gamers remain motivated, driven by the desire to climb the leaderboard and make a tangible impact in their communities.
Corporate Quests: Engaging the Workforce
We extend the SDG Daily Quest to the corporate world, encouraging employees to participate in SDG-related tasks within their workflow. These corporate quests are tailored to align with the company's sustainability goals and daily operations. Employees document their tasks similarly, earning points that convert into a unique currency within the BARBAH Games platform. 
Currency Accumulation and Benefits
The points accrued through both community and corporate quests accumulate as a currency that offers tangible benefits. This currency can be used within the BARBAH Games platform for various purposes, including:
●	Enhancing Gameplay: Employees can trade in their currency to boost the gamers they sponsor during the Saturday SDG teams gaming competitions.
●	Rewards and Recognition: Both gamers and corporate employees can redeem their currency for rewards such as gift cards, exclusive in-game items, and certificates of achievement.
●	Corporate Benefits: Companies can showcase their commitment to the SDGs, boosting their brand image and engaging employees in meaningful activities.

Weekly Recap and Team Formation
At the end of each week, we celebrate the achievements of our community and corporate participants with a comprehensive weekly recap ( leaderboard recognitions) . This recap highlights the total points accumulated, showcases the top contributors, and features notable submissions. But the excitement doesn’t end there.
Teams  categorized per SDG alignment will get to compete. The two top teams will play the Domination C4 map. The teams to play will be determined by quest submissions. Teams can solicit Quest tokens from Corporate Sponsors to get bumped into the running for the Saturday tournament. Using data we will strive to have balanced teams, ensuring that every team has a diverse mix of skills and perspectives. These teams are assigned a specific bucket of SDGs to focus on, creating a framework that not only organizes the quests but also fosters a sense of belonging and purpose among team members. The teams become national movements, generating excitement and pride in being associated with them.
Team Formation for the SDGs
To drive engagement and ensure a structured approach to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and adhering to the 10 Global Compact Principles, we will create specialized teams within the BARBAH Games community. These teams will be themed around  the SDGs, fostering a sense of purpose, collaboration, and community involvement.
Personality Test for Team Assignment
Upon signing up we need to give each gamer a personality test. This test will determine their strengths, interests, and SDG passions, ensuring they are placed in a team that aligns with their personal and professional aspirations. The goal is to form balanced teams with diverse skill sets and perspectives. 
Team Structure and Composition
We will create a total of 7 teams, each focusing on a cluster of SDGs and represented by Astro or the Fortnite character. Each team will incorporate the 10 Global Compact Principles, ensuring that their quests and activities align with broader ethical and sustainability standards.
