challenges to operating responsibly and have different opportunities to make a positive impact. Companies with operations and supply chains extending around the world need to understand locations far from headquarters and view sustainability through a local lens.\n\nOur Global Compact Local Networks advance the initiative and its Ten Principles at the country level. They help companies understand what responsible business means within different national, cultural and language contexts and facilitate outreach, learning, policy dialogue, collective action and partnerships. Through our networks, companies can make local connections – with other businesses and stakeholders from NGOs, government and academia – and receive guidance to put their sustainability commitments into action.\n\nWhile Local Networks are independent, self-governed and self-managed entities, they work closely with the UN Global Compact in New York and act as a point of contact for UN Global Compact signatories in a country.\n\n### Local Networks and the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nResponsible business has a vital role to play in the success of the Decade of Action. The private sector can contribute to the mainstreaming of the SDGs at the local level through its Local Network by:\n\n1.  Participating in Global Compact Network multi-stakeholder convenings including policy dialogues\n2.  Participating in Global Compact Network Working Groups, joining dedicated passionate professionals aimed at developing local solutions\n3.  Promoting and incorporating accountability measures to report on progress made towards implementing the SDGs within companies\n\n*   [Find out more about local

challenges to operating responsibly and have different opportunities to make a positive impact. Companies with operations and supply chains extending around the world need to understand locations far from headquarters and view sustainability through a local lens.\n\nOur Global Compact Local Networks advance the initiative and its Ten Principles at the country level. They help companies understand what responsible business means within different national, cultural and language contexts and facilitate outreach, learning, policy dialogue, collective action and partnerships. Through our networks, companies can make local connections – with other businesses and stakeholders from NGOs, government and academia – and receive guidance to put their sustainability commitments into action.\n\nWhile Local Networks are independent, self-governed and self-managed entities, they work closely with the UN Global Compact in New York and act as a point of contact for UN Global Compact signatories in a country.\n\n### Local Networks and the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nResponsible business has a vital role to play in the success of the Decade of Action. The private sector can contribute to the mainstreaming of the SDGs at the local level through its Local Network by:\n\n1.  Participating in Global Compact Network multi-stakeholder convenings including policy dialogues\n2.  Participating in Global Compact Network Working Groups, joining dedicated passionate professionals aimed at developing local solutions\n3.  Promoting and incorporating accountability measures to report on progress made towards implementing the SDGs within companies\n\n*   [Find out more about local

This programme enables companies to move beyond incremental progress and step up transformative change, unlocking business value, building business resilience, and enabling long-term growth.  \n\nOriginally developed in 2019, the programme has now reached **over 90 countries** and **2,000+ companies** in all industries.\n\nSDG Ambition Accelerator will empower and equip participating companies of the UN Global Compact to develop and implement innovative business strategies that significantly increase their positive impact on the SDGs. Through the Global Compact Country Networks, participating companies will assess current performance, identify risk areas, discover new opportunities across business units and functions and take ambitious business action towards achieving the SDGs.\n\nParticipating in the SDG Ambition Accelerator allows companies to select benchmarks linked to the [Forward Faster](https://forwardfaster.unglobalcompact.org/)\n targets and use the 8-step approach to help them reach their goals. Almost 70% of companies from previous rounds have committed to adopting SDG Ambition Benchmarks associated with the Forward Faster Initiative. After completing the SDG Ambition Accelerator, companies with goals related to Forward Faster will be invited to join the initiative. This will give them access to:\n\n*   **Recognition:** Receive public recognition for demonstrating highest level ambition ensuring transparency and credibility in sustainability efforts while avoiding the pitfalls of greenwashing.\n*   **Policy advocacy:** Gain access to closed-door policy dialogues and high-level convenings, influencing decision-making processes and shaping impactful policies.\n*   **Thought Leadership:** Showcase successes through case studies, speaking engagements, and featured impact stories, inspiring others with your sustainability leadership\n*   **Global Forums and convenings:** Secure access to global forums, enabling leadership representation, peer exchange and amplifying ambitious actions on a worldwide stage ensuring a genuine commitment to sustainability.\n\n* * *\n\n**PROGRAMME BENEFITS**\n\n*   **Enhanced alignment with the SDGs:** The program helps companies align their business strategies with the SDGs, providing a framework to integrate sustainability into their core business practices and goals and a systems thinking approach.\n*   **Improved business performance**: Aligning business strategies with the SDGs represents a market opportunity and leads to financial success in the long run. The program allows companies to identify new business opportunities, lower expenses, and enhance risk management.\n*   **Access to resources and expertise:** The program provides guidance, peer-to-peer learning opportunities, networking opportunities, and a clear methodology beyond the SDGs.\n*   **Improved innovation:** By prioritizing the SDGs, companies can stimulate innovation and the development of new products, services, and business models that meet the needs of a rapidly changing world.\n*   **Reinforced resilience:** Businesses prioritizing sustainability have a better chance of enduring disruptions and adapting to shifting market conditions and regulatory changes. This resilience can enhance their long-term market competitiveness.\n*   Participate in the **Forward Faster initiative** by selecting SDG Ambition Benchmarks linked to the Forward Faster targets.\n\n* * *\n\n**WHAT YOU WILL GAIN**\n\n* * *\n\n*   How to strategically prioritize actions & goals that will accelerate your company’s contribution to the 2030 Agenda.\n*   How to set targets aligned with aspirational ambition benchmarks to spearhead the transformation of economies and societies.\n*   How to identify subgoals & track performance metrics to evaluate progress and inform iterative decision-making.\n*   How to approach sustainability management and design new business processes & systems that integrate SDG goals across multiple parts of the business.\n*   How to build a business case and generate sustainability buy-in from your company.\n*   A comprehensive 8-step approach to take you through all the steps above, from strategic prioritization to actioning on system opportunities to accelerate integration.\n\n**Who can participate**\n\nThe UN Global Compact invites companies to join SDG Ambition Accelerator.

Beijing](/take-action/impact/beijing-company-looks-to-global-compact-in-its-gender-equality-efforts)\n    \n\nBeijing company looks to Global Compact in its gender equality efforts\n======================================================================\n\nZhou Tong knows plenty about challenges in the workplace.\n\nBorn blind, she shuttled through many part-time and short-term jobs, unable to find suitable and worthwhile work. \n\nThat was before she landed her job at Beijing Prudence Interactive, a 6-year-old startup that designs technology for people who are visually impaired. The company has been using its membership in the UN Global Compact to strive for gender equality in its workforce.\n\n“Even the interview for this job left me feeling good. I was a 29-year-old female but I was not asked whether I was married or had children and, ever since, I don’t feel I have been treated differently because I am a woman,” Zhou said.\n\n“In my previous experience of job searching, I came across a lot of obstacles as a person with disabilities, not to mention that I am a female,” she added.\n\nZhou started at Beijing Prudence doing social media, then moved to planning and training. Now at age 33, she is Head of New Media Operations.\n\nParticipating in the Target Gender Equality Accelerator has helped Beijing Prudence develop an actionable gender equality roadmap, said Wang Lu, its Deputy General Manager.\n\n“The company is still quite young. Although we had our own policies for hiring and managing employees, our work on gender equality and HR management was not so systematic and detailed,” Wang said.\n\n“Joining the UN Global Compact has helped us understand sustainability and follow the Ten Principles which will help us fulfill our environmental and social frameworks provided by the Accelerator to develop a comprehensive action plan to achieve these goals,” she said.\n\nThe company relays lessons learned from its UN Global Compact training to its staff and says its next step is using more internal training and awareness raising to reach full 50-50 gender equality.  Currently, about 30 per cent of the staff is female.\n\nAssessing and analyzing its performance through the WEPs Gender Gap Analysis Tool, “we learned how to set goals to enhance women’s leadership and use the templates and frameworks provided by the Accelerator to develop a comprehensive action plan to achieve these goals,” said Wang.\n\nThe company’s commitment towards achieving gender equality has paid off, said Zhou.\n\n“Working here, I feel women are treated as equals,” she said. “There have been no limits to my personal and professional growth, and I have been encouraged to try new things.”\n\nLeveraging technologies such as the internet, 5G and artificial intelligence, the company creates mobile internet communities, entertainment products and life skills training for people who have little or no vision. Products include a mobile screen reader, an online game called “Battle Against Darkness” that is available through Apple and an online community platform.\n\nIts technology gives people with vision impairment networking opportunities that otherwise tend to be limited, especially for women, Zhou said.\n\nIn fact, she said she knows of several examples of people who met on the company’s platforms and went on to get married.\n\n“That is one reason I really like the products we make,” she said.\n\nBeijing Prudence offers a flexible working policy that allows employees to work online. Along with the statutory maternity leave of 128 days and paternity leave of 15 days, it provides 14 days of extra maternity and paternity leave and flexible working hours for female employees during the postnatal period.\n\n“We have a long learning journey ahead of us, but gender equality is important to us,” said Wang.\n\n“Women play an important role in society and women have the same abilities as men. So we aim to give all our employees the same opportunity,” she said.\n\n*   News\n*   Events\n*   Academy\n\nNews\n====\n\n*   [18-Jun-2024\\\n    \\\n    New York, United States of America\\\n

The company has been using its membership in the UN Global Compact to strive for gender equality in its workforce.\n\n“Even the interview for this job left me feeling good. I was a 29-year-old female but I was not asked whether I was married or had children and, ever since, I don’t feel I have been treated differently because I am a woman,” Zhou said.\n\n“In my previous experience of job searching, I came across a lot of obstacles as a person with disabilities, not to mention that I am a female,” she added.\n\nZhou started at Beijing Prudence doing social media, then moved to planning and training. Now at age 33, she is Head of New Media Operations.\n\nParticipating in the Target Gender Equality Accelerator has helped Beijing Prudence develop an actionable gender equality roadmap, said Wang Lu, its Deputy General Manager.\n\n“The company is still quite young. Although we had our own policies for hiring and managing employees, our work on gender equality and HR management was not so systematic and detailed,” Wang said.\n\n“Joining the UN Global Compact has helped us understand sustainability and follow the Ten Principles which will help us fulfill our environmental and social frameworks provided by the Accelerator to develop a comprehensive action plan to achieve these goals,” she said.\n\nThe company relays lessons learned from its UN Global Compact training to its staff and says its next step is using more internal training and awareness raising to reach full 50-50 gender equality.  Currently, about 30 per cent of the staff is female.\n\nAssessing and analyzing its performance through the WEPs Gender Gap Analysis Tool, “we learned how to set goals to enhance women’s leadership and use the templates and frameworks provided by the Accelerator to develop a comprehensive action plan to achieve these goals,” said Wang.\n\nThe company’s commitment towards achieving gender equality has paid off, said Zhou.\n\n“Working here, I feel women are treated as equals,” she said. “There have been no limits to my personal and professional growth, and I have been encouraged to try new things.”\n\nLeveraging technologies such as the internet, 5G and artificial intelligence, the company creates mobile internet communities, entertainment products and life skills training for people who have little or no vision. Products include a mobile screen reader, an online game called “Battle Against Darkness” that is available through Apple and an online community platform.\n\nIts technology gives people with vision impairment networking opportunities that otherwise tend to be limited, especially for women, Zhou said.\n\nIn fact, she said she knows of several examples of people who met on the company’s platforms and went on to get married.\n\n“That is one reason I really like the products we make,” she said.\n\nBeijing Prudence offers a flexible working policy that allows employees to work online. Along with the statutory maternity leave of 128 days and paternity leave of 15 days, it provides 14 days of extra maternity and paternity leave and flexible working hours for female employees during the postnatal period.\n\n“We have a long learning journey ahead of us, but gender equality is important to us,” said Wang.\n\n“Women play an important role in society and women have the same abilities as men. So we aim to give all our employees the same opportunity,” she said.\n\n*   News\n*   Events\n*   Academy\n\nNews\n====\n\n*   [18-Jun-2024\\\n    \\\n    New York, United States of America\\\n

[More about Principle 9](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-9)\n    \n\nThe world today is facing unprecedented, interconnected environmental challenges in areas including climate change, clean water, ocean health and biodiversity. New corporate efforts are needed to increase stewardship of natural resources, implement innovative solutions, and contribute to sustainable development.\n\nTo accelerate progress, the UN Global Compact has developed several frameworks for companies to embed sustainability into their strategy and take action to secure a resilient future. Our efforts address the linkages among various environmental issues — climate, water, ocean — as well as the social and governance dimensions. In this Decade of Action, our goal is to help businesses scale up impact towards the Sustainable Development Goals and the ambitious targets set in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThis year’s COP26 represents a major milestone as the world looks to recover better from the global pandemic and implement the transformative change necessary to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Collective action will be critical and we call on businesses to assess environmental risks and opportunities, set and deliver ambitious environmental targets and adopt responsible practices for a transition to the net-zero, resilient economy.\n\n  \n\n[Contact Us](https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/action/climate/contact-points)\n [Sign up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nMore

[More about Principle 9](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-9)\n    \n\nThe world today is facing unprecedented, interconnected environmental challenges in areas including climate change, clean water, ocean health and biodiversity. New corporate efforts are needed to increase stewardship of natural resources, implement innovative solutions, and contribute to sustainable development.\n\nTo accelerate progress, the UN Global Compact has developed several frameworks for companies to embed sustainability into their strategy and take action to secure a resilient future. Our efforts address the linkages among various environmental issues — climate, water, ocean — as well as the social and governance dimensions. In this Decade of Action, our goal is to help businesses scale up impact towards the Sustainable Development Goals and the ambitious targets set in the Paris Agreement.\n\nThis year’s COP26 represents a major milestone as the world looks to recover better from the global pandemic and implement the transformative change necessary to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Collective action will be critical and we call on businesses to assess environmental risks and opportunities, set and deliver ambitious environmental targets and adopt responsible practices for a transition to the net-zero, resilient economy.\n\n  \n\n[Contact Us](https://unglobalcompact.org/take-action/action/climate/contact-points)\n [Sign up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nMore

[Integrate the Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME)](/what-is-gc/our-work/management-education)\n    \n\nSocial Sustainability\n=====================\n\nSocial sustainability is about identifying and managing business impacts, both positive and negative, on people. The quality of a company’s relationships and engagement with its stakeholders is critical. Directly or indirectly, companies affect what happens to employees, workers in the value chain, customers and local communities, and it is important to manage impacts proactively.\n\nBusinesses’ social license to operate depends greatly on their social sustainability efforts. In addition, a lack of social development, including poverty, inequality and weak rule of law, can hamper business operations and growth.\n\nAt the same time, actions to achieve social sustainability may unlock new markets, help retain and attract business partners, or be the source for innovation for new product or service lines. Internal morale and employee engagement may rise, while productivity, risk management and company-community conflict improve.\n\nThe first six of the UN Global Compact's principles focus on this social dimension of corporate sustainability, of which human rights is the cornerstone. Our work on social sustainability also covers the human rights of specific groups: labour, women's empowerment and gender equality, children, indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, as well as people-centered approaches to business impacts on poverty. As well as covering groups of rights holders, social sustainability encompasses issues that affecting them, for example, education and health.\n\nWhile it is the primary duty of governments to protect, respect, fulfil and progressively realize human rights, businesses can, and should, do their part. At a minimum, we expect businesses to undertake due diligence to avoid harming human rights and to address any adverse impacts on human rights that may be related to their activities.\n\nAs a complement, not as a substitute for respecting rights, businesses can also take additional steps:\n\n*   Contribute in other ways to improve the lives of the people they affect, such as by creating decent jobs, goods and services that help meet basic needs, and more inclusive value chains.\n*   Make strategic social investments and promote public policies that support social sustainability.\n*   Partner with other businesses, pooling strengths to make a greater positive impact.\n\nContact\n=======\n\nSocial Sustainability Team\n--------------------------\n\nUN Global

The quality of a company’s relationships and engagement with its stakeholders is critical. Directly or indirectly, companies affect what happens to employees, workers in the value chain, customers and local communities, and it is important to manage impacts proactively.\n\nBusinesses’ social license to operate depends greatly on their social sustainability efforts. In addition, a lack of social development, including poverty, inequality and weak rule of law, can hamper business operations and growth.\n\nAt the same time, actions to achieve social sustainability may unlock new markets, help retain and attract business partners, or be the source for innovation for new product or service lines. Internal morale and employee engagement may rise, while productivity, risk management and company-community conflict improve.\n\nThe first six of the UN Global Compact's principles focus on this social dimension of corporate sustainability, of which human rights is the cornerstone. Our work on social sustainability also covers the human rights of specific groups: labour, women's empowerment and gender equality, children, indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, as well as people-centered approaches to business impacts on poverty. As well as covering groups of rights holders, social sustainability encompasses issues that affecting them, for example, education and health.\n\nWhile it is the primary duty of governments to protect, respect, fulfil and progressively realize human rights, businesses can, and should, do their part. At a minimum, we expect businesses to undertake due diligence to avoid harming human rights and to address any adverse impacts on human rights that may be related to their activities.\n\nAs a complement, not as a substitute for respecting rights, businesses can also take additional steps:\n\n*   Contribute in other ways to improve the lives of the people they affect, such as by creating decent jobs, goods and services that help meet basic needs, and more inclusive value chains.\n*   Make strategic social investments and promote public policies that support social sustainability.\n*   Partner with other businesses, pooling strengths to make a greater positive impact.\n\nContact\n=======\n\nSocial Sustainability Team\n--------------------------\n\nUN Global

effectiveness of an entity – whether a business, government or multilateral institution.  \n\nThe United Nations Global Compact has two separate programmes teams working with our participants & partners to better tackle SDG 16 as well as the \"G\" in \"ESG\": \n\n1\\. Anti-Corruption Programmes\n\n2\\. Transformational Governance Programmes\n\nPromoting good governance is a multi-dimensional challenge, which requires efforts that are mutually reinforcing. For example, anti-corruption is essential to the rule of law and peace-building because corruption negatively impacts state capacity, social inclusion, and management of natural resources. Peace is an enabler of sustainable development and is a pre-condition for the establishment of the rule of law and efforts to reduce corruption. Finally, rule of law is necessary to effectively address the drivers of violent conflict, illicit financial flows, and impunity, and to provide a legal framework which ensures impartiality and predictability.\n\nCompanies can engage with the UN Global Compact on the three critical governance topics: anti-corruption, peace, and rule of law. At the micro level, companies can enhance good governance by integrating corporate sustainability principles into their own operations and relationships, allowing for greater transparency, accountability and inclusiveness. At the macro level, companies can contribute to the development and implementation of international norms and standards, for instance, as part of their commitment to the UN Global Compact.\n\nBy focusing on the ways companies can contribute anti-corruption, peace and rule of law, at both the global and local levels, the UN Global Compact is able harness the power of responsible business to respect and support the promotion of accountable and inclusive institutions and ensure just and peaceful societies for all.\n\nContact\n=======\n\n![](https://unglobalcompact.org/ungc-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/contacts/images/404693/original/Photo_-_Cristina_Ritter.jpg?1694024807)\n\nMs. Cristina

Anti-Corruption Programmes\n\n2\\. Transformational Governance Programmes\n\nPromoting good governance is a multi-dimensional challenge, which requires efforts that are mutually reinforcing. For example, anti-corruption is essential to the rule of law and peace-building because corruption negatively impacts state capacity, social inclusion, and management of natural resources. Peace is an enabler of sustainable development and is a pre-condition for the establishment of the rule of law and efforts to reduce corruption. Finally, rule of law is necessary to effectively address the drivers of violent conflict, illicit financial flows, and impunity, and to provide a legal framework which ensures impartiality and predictability.\n\nCompanies can engage with the UN Global Compact on the three critical governance topics: anti-corruption, peace, and rule of law. At the micro level, companies can enhance good governance by integrating corporate sustainability principles into their own operations and relationships, allowing for greater transparency, accountability and inclusiveness. At the macro level, companies can contribute to the development and implementation of international norms and standards, for instance, as part of their commitment to the UN Global Compact.\n\nBy focusing on the ways companies can contribute anti-corruption, peace and rule of law, at both the global and local levels, the UN Global Compact is able harness the power of responsible business to respect and support the promotion of accountable and inclusive institutions and ensure just and peaceful societies for all.\n\nContact\n=======\n\n![](https://unglobalcompact.org/ungc-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/contacts/images/404693/original/Photo_-_Cristina_Ritter.jpg?1694024807)\n\nMs. Cristina

Please note that such materials, along with the rest of the CoP, will be publicly available upon submission.  <br>  <br>Once submitted, the CoP will be available to download as a PDF file by the participant through the digital platform. Additionally, the CoP will be publicly available to view on each respective participant profile.  <br>  <br>In rare cases, it may be possible to amend a submitted CoP. Please refer to the [CoP Amendment Policy](https://unglobalcompact.org/library/6201)<br> for additional information. |\n\n**_Please note that all data, including supplemental documentation that was submitted by a participating company through the CoP digital platform, will be made publicly available on the UN Global Compact website.

Overview\n==================\n\nPeer Learning Groups[](https://www.unglobalcompact.org.uk/global-goals-sdginnovation/)\n\nFacing tough challenges in the constantly evolving world of sustainability and feeling the pressure from both consumers and shareholders, sustainability professionals across the globe are looking for opportunities to connect with their peers for insights and knowledge sharing.\n\nPeer Learning Groups at the UN Global Compact create a safe space for companies to share their best practices and challenges on critical sustainability issues with like-minded professionals, while gaining access to industry leaders and unique networking opportunities.\n\nRun in collaboration with Global Compact Local Networks, Peer Learning Groups in 2024 will focus on six priority issue tracks — **climate action, gender equality, living wage, water resilience, finance & investment** and **SMEs** — with the goal of moving companies forward in taking ambitious action on these issues.\n\nThrough facilitated sessions, curated resources and group discussions, participants learn about the latest best practices in any given issue area in a trusted, regulated environment.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **What you will experience**<br><br>* * *<br><br>*   Learn from the challenges other companies are facing<br>*   Share ideas about solutions that could help overcome those challenges<br>*   Identify trends on emerging innovations that may be applicable to your company contexts<br>*   Network with like-minded sustainability professionals | **What you

on six priority issue tracks: **climate action, gender equality, living wage, water resilience, finance & investment** and **SMEs**. Companies may choose to participate in a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6 priority issue tracks. (Please see below for a list of issue tracks offered in your country.)\n\nEach issue track encompasses 4-6 sessions annually. Sessions are facilitated by UN Global Compact staff and bring together 20-60 participants from different industries and sectors in your region.\n\nLeading up to each session, participants receive materials from the UN Global Compact to help them prepare. During the session, participants learn through case studies, breakout sessions and discussion forms.\n\n**Priority Issue Tracks**  \n  \n\nSimply click on the priority issue tracks below and view which Local Networks are offering them in 2024.\n\n![](https://info.unglobalcompact.org/l/591891/2023-12-04/58gz2v/591891/1701722788CDeqRgmQ/PLG_Priority_Issue_Tracks_Climate_Action.png)\n\n*   Austria\n*   [Canada](https://unglobalcompact.ca/take-action/page.php?id=32)\n    \n*   France\n*   Ireland\n*   Mexico\n*   [Netherlands](https://unglobalcompact.nl/en/global-compact-network-netherlands-launched-peer-learning-groups-for-participants/)\n    \n*   Norway\n*   Sri Lanka\n*   Network USA\n\n![](https://info.unglobalcompact.org/l/591891/2023-12-04/58gz32/591891/1704902731UMqnzQoG/PLG_Priority_Issue_Tracks_Gender_Equality.png)\n\n*   Austria\n*   France\n*   Greece\n*   Ireland\n*   Mexico\n*   Nepal\n*   South Africa\n*   Sri Lanka\n\n![](https://info.unglobalcompact.org/l/591891/2023-12-04/58gz35/591891/1704902571vAO0zaf1/PLG_Priority_Issue_Tracks_Living_Wage.png)\n\n*   France\n*   Georgia\n*   Mexico\n*   Portugal\n*   Switzerland and Liechtenstein\n\n![](https://info.unglobalcompact.org/l/591891/2023-12-04/58gz3c/591891/1704902492nFgfRZZh/PLG_Priority_Issue_Tracks_Water_Resilience.png)\n\n*   Mexico\n*   Portugal\n*   Sri Lanka\n\n![](https://info.unglobalcompact.org/l/591891/2023-12-04/58gz2y/591891/1704902880hOdKvqYC/PLG_Priority_Issue_Tracks_Finance___Investment.png)\n\n*   Austria\n*   Central America\n*   France\n*   Mexico\n*   Portugal\n*   United Kingdom\n\n![](https://info.unglobalcompact.org/l/591891/2023-12-04/58gz38/591891/17049023844HMCwsdJ/PLG_Priority_Issue_Tracks_SMEs.png)\n\n*   Austria\n*   France\n*   Ireland\n*   Latin America and the Caribbean\n*   Mexico\n*   Portugal\n*   South Africa\n*   Spain\n*   Sri Lanka\n\n[DOWNLOAD BROCHURE](https://info.unglobalcompact.org/peer_learning_groups_brochure)\n\n  \n\n**Interested in Participating?**\n\nTo participate in the Peer Learning Groups programme, companies are required to meet the following criteria:\n\n*   Be a participant of the UN Global Compact in good standing\n*   Currently engaged with a Global Compact Local Network in your country or willing to join\n*   Able to appoint two representatives that can commit to joining 4 to 6 sessions annually\n*   Willing to candidly share, learn and engage with peers.

Forum\n====================\n\nOverview\n========\n\nSave the Date!\n--------------\n\nSince 2008, the annual UN Private Sector Forum (PSF) has gathered global leaders at the United Nations during UN General Assembly week to address major global issues such as climate change, sustainable development and human rights. Co-hosted with the UN Secretary-General and organized by the UN Global Compact, the event will provide a unique opportunity for Chief Executives, Heads of State and Government as well as UN leaders to engage in a multi-stakeholder, intergenerational dialogue to align on an urgent and collective course of action in tackling the developing crises around the world.  \n  \n**Access to the Private Sector Forum is only available to select Chief Executive Officers from highly engaged UN Global Compact Participants (for example Participants who have signed on to the Forward Faster Initiative). Some non-participant organizations will be invited on a case-by-case basis.**\n\nSep 23, 2024 at 12:00 pm\n\nUN Headquarters, New York, NY , United States of America\n\nContact\n=======\n\nUN Global Compact Strategic Events Team\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvents\n\n[events@unglobalcompact.org](mailto:events@unglobalcompact.org)\n\n[2129071301](tel:2129071301)\n\n[Learn More](https://events.unglobalcompact.org/psf24/Home)\n\nHelp us transform the world through business\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[Contribute Today](/about/foundation)\n\n[Sign Up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nHave a Question?\n----------------\n\n[Frequently Asked Questions](/about/faq)\n  \n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nFollow Us\n---------\n\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n     [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UNGlobalCompact)\n     [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact)\n     [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/globalcompact)\n     [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvGxh25-RUvCcZJXHj32Zzg)\n     [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ungc)\n     [RSS](http://feeds.unglobalcompact.org/UnitedNationsGlobalCompact-LatestNews)\n    \n\nQuickLinks\n----------\n\n*   [The Ten Principles](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n    \n*   [Sustainable Development Goals](/sdgs)\n    \n*   [Our Participants](/what-is-gc/participants)\n    \n*   [All Our Work](/what-is-gc/our-work/all)\n    \n*   [What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n    \n*   [Careers & Opportunities](/about/opportunities)\n    \n*   [Join Now](/join-us)\n    \n*   [Prepare your CoP](/participation/report/cop)\n    \n\n[Tweets by @globalcompact](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n\n*   [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/)\n    \n*   [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n    \n*   [Cookies Policy](/privacy-policy/cookies_notice)\n    \n*   [Copyright](/copyright)\n    \n*   [Photo Credits](/photo-credits)\n    \n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n×\n\nThis website uses cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best experience when using our website.  With your permission, we also set performance and functionality cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies and social media cookies.  You can click “Accept all” below if you are happy for us to place cookies (you can always change your mind later).  For more information please see our [Cookie Policy](https://unglobalcompact.org/privacy-policy)\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nSave & Close\n\nAccept all\n\nDecline all\n\nShow details Hide details\n\nCookie declaration\n\nAbout cookies\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nStrictly necessary cookies allow core website functionality such as user login and account management.

Forum\n====================\n\nOverview\n========\n\nSave the Date!\n--------------\n\nSince 2008, the annual UN Private Sector Forum (PSF) has gathered global leaders at the United Nations during UN General Assembly week to address major global issues such as climate change, sustainable development and human rights. Co-hosted with the UN Secretary-General and organized by the UN Global Compact, the event will provide a unique opportunity for Chief Executives, Heads of State and Government as well as UN leaders to engage in a multi-stakeholder, intergenerational dialogue to align on an urgent and collective course of action in tackling the developing crises around the world.  \n  \n**Access to the Private Sector Forum is only available to select Chief Executive Officers from highly engaged UN Global Compact Participants (for example Participants who have signed on to the Forward Faster Initiative). Some non-participant organizations will be invited on a case-by-case basis.**\n\nSep 23, 2024 at 12:00 pm\n\nUN Headquarters, New York, NY , United States of America\n\nContact\n=======\n\nUN Global Compact Strategic Events Team\n---------------------------------------\n\nEvents\n\n[events@unglobalcompact.org](mailto:events@unglobalcompact.org)\n\n[2129071301](tel:2129071301)\n\n[Learn More](https://events.unglobalcompact.org/psf24/Home)\n\nHelp us transform the world through business\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[Contribute Today](/about/foundation)\n\n[Sign Up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nHave a Question?\n----------------\n\n[Frequently Asked Questions](/about/faq)\n  \n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nFollow Us\n---------\n\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n     [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UNGlobalCompact)\n     [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact)\n     [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/globalcompact)\n     [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvGxh25-RUvCcZJXHj32Zzg)\n     [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ungc)\n     [RSS](http://feeds.unglobalcompact.org/UnitedNationsGlobalCompact-LatestNews)\n    \n\nQuickLinks\n----------\n\n*   [The Ten Principles](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n    \n*   [Sustainable Development Goals](/sdgs)\n    \n*   [Our Participants](/what-is-gc/participants)\n    \n*   [All Our Work](/what-is-gc/our-work/all)\n    \n*   [What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n    \n*   [Careers & Opportunities](/about/opportunities)\n    \n*   [Join Now](/join-us)\n    \n*   [Prepare your CoP](/participation/report/cop)\n    \n\n[Tweets by @globalcompact](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n\n*   [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/)\n    \n*   [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n    \n*   [Cookies Policy](/privacy-policy/cookies_notice)\n    \n*   [Copyright](/copyright)\n    \n*   [Photo Credits](/photo-credits)\n    \n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n×\n\nThis website uses cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best experience when using our website.  With your permission, we also set performance and functionality cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies and social media cookies.  You can click “Accept all” below if you are happy for us to place cookies (you can always change your mind later).  For more information please see our [Cookie Policy](https://unglobalcompact.org/privacy-policy)\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nSave & Close\n\nAccept all\n\nDecline all\n\nShow details Hide details\n\nCookie declaration\n\nAbout cookies\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nStrictly necessary cookies allow core website functionality such as user login and account management.

Governance](/about/governance)\n    \n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n==========================\n\nHow do companies participate in the UN Global Compact?\n======================================================\n\nAs a voluntary initiative, the United Nations Global Compact seeks wide participation from a diverse group of businesses. As a participant of the UN Global Compact, a company:\n\n*   Sets in motion changes to business operations so that the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles become part of strategy, culture and day-to-day operations;\n*   Is expected to publicly advocate the UN Global Compact and its principles via communications vehicles such as press releases, speeches, etc; and\n*   Is required to communicate with their stakeholders on an annual basis about progress in:\n    1.  Implementing the Ten Principles and\n    2.  Efforts to support societal priorities.\n\nThe [Communication on Progress](/participation/report/cop)\n (CoP) is a visible expression of your commitment to sustainability and your stakeholders can view it on your company’s profile page. Companies that fail to report or to meet the criteria over time may be removed from the initiative.\n\nThere are a number of ways that companies can take action to embed corporate sustainability into their DNA. [Find out what you can do](/take-action/action)\n.\n\nWho can join the UN Global Compact?\n===================================\n\nParticipation in the UN Global Compact is open to any company that is serious about its commitment to work towards implementation of the UN Global Compact principles throughout its operations and sphere of influence, and to communicate on its progress.\n\nProperly constituted (under prevailing national law) companies from any industry sector are eligible for participation, except those companies that meet the following exclusionary criteria:\n\n*   Subject to a UN sanction\n*   Listed on the UN Ineligible Vendors List for ethical reasons\n*   Derive revenue from the production, sale and/or transfer of antipersonnel landmines or cluster bombs\n*   Derive revenue from the production and/or manufacture of tobacco\n\nThe exclusionary criteria were updated on 12 September 2017. [See here for more information](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/about_the_gc/Integrity_measures/integrity-recommendation-2017.pdf)\n.\n\nHow can non-governmental organizations and other non-business participants get involved?\n========================================================================================\n\nAs equal partners and important stakeholders, civil society and other non-business organisations can participate through a number of UN Global Compact engagement mechanisms, including policy dialogues, learning, [Local Networks](/engage-locally)\n and [partnership projects](/take-action/partnerships)\n. In these areas, such organizations have a crucial role to play in helping to foster partnerships and produce substantive action. Non-business participants are also encouraged to commit their organization to the ten principles and to report on progress made within their organization. [More information about non-business participation in the UN Global Compact](/participation/join/who-should-join/non-business)\n.\n\nIs the UN Global Compact legally binding?\n=========================================\n\nNo. The UN Global Compact is a purely voluntary initiative. It does not police or enforce the behaviour or actions of companies. Rather, it is designed to stimulate change and to promote corporate sustainability and encourage innovative solutions and partnerships.\n\nIs the UN Global Compact a substitute for existing regulatory approaches?\n=========================================================================\n\nNo. The UN Global Compact views itself as complementing other voluntary initiatives and regulatory approaches by helping to establish the business case for human rights, labour standards, environmental stewardship and the fight against corruption. The UN Global Compact is a purely voluntary initiative designed to promote innovation in relation to corporate sustainability. Many of the existing standards support the principles of the UN Global Compact and are therefore are quite consistent with its overall objectives.\n\nWhy should a company that has already established its own code of conduct participate in the UN Global Compact?\n===============================================================================================================\n\nCorporate codes of conduct are extremely important and many companies have demonstrated leadership and positive change through their development and implementation. The UN Global Compact is not a code of conduct. Rather, it offers a policy framework for organizing and developing corporate sustainability strategies while offering a platform — based on universal principles — to encourage innovative initiatives and partnerships with civil society, Governments and other stakeholders\n\nAre there any financial obligations in becoming a UN Global Compact participant?\n================================================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact is a voluntary initiative, not a formal membership organization. Upon joining the UN Global Compact, larger companies are required to make an annual contribution to support their engagement in the UN Global Compact. These contributions support both our global and country-level operations and, by agreement, are split between the global secretariat and Local Networks.\n\nGlobal contributions are received, administered and distributed through the Foundation for the Global Compact – a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization – and are therefore tax deductible in many jurisdictions. Learn more about our [Finances](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/about/finances)\n.\n\nI operate an organization with less than 10 employees. Can I still participate in the UN Global Compact?\n========================================================================================================\n\nAs of 1 January 2018, we began revising our criteria to accept applications from companies and organizations with fewer than ten direct employees.\n\nStarting in January 2020, the UN Global Compact will accept all businesses and organizations that fulfill the criteria for participation, regardless of the number of employees. All participating companies and organizations are still required to have at least one direct employee and active operations.\n\nCan company subsidiaries join the UN Global Compact?\n====================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact applies the leadership principle. If the CEO of a company's global parent (holding, group, etc.) embraces the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact by sending a letter to the UN Secretary-General, the UN Global Compact will post only the name of the parent company on the global list assuming that all subsidiaries participate as well. Subsidiaries that wish to directly send a letter to the UN Secretary-General to underline their commitment, whether alongside the parent company or individually, will be listed as participants, and are invited to actively participate in our activities at the global and local level, including through becoming active in the Global Compact Local Network of their host country. To learn more about how subsidiaries can join the UN Global Compact see [here](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/about_the_gc/policy/UNGlobalCompact_SubsidiaryPolicy.pdf)\n.\n\nWhat if my company chooses to no longer participate in the UN Global Compact?\n=============================================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact is a voluntary initiative, and signatories are free to end their participation at any time. Participants may decide to withdraw if they determine they are not in a position to continue their participation in the initiative or if they are unable to uphold their commitment to the Ten Principles. The intention to withdraw should be communicated in writing by an authorized representative of the participating company/organization and specify the reasons for ending the commitment.\n\nAs a result of the request to withdraw, the participant’s status on the UN Global Compact website will be updated to “de-listed” and the reason for delisting will indicate “Participant requested withdrawal”.  \n\nIf there is no monitoring or enforcement, how does the UN Global Compact know that a company is truthfully portraying its actions?\n==================================================================================================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact is not a performance or assessment tool. It does not provide a seal of approval, nor does it make judgments on performance.\n\nParticipants are expected to publish in their annual report or similar corporate report (e.g. sustainability report) a description of the ways in which they are supporting the UN Global Compact and its ten principles. This is known as the [Communication on Progress](/participation/report/cop)\n. The UN Global Compact believes that this sort of openness and transparency encourages improved practices by participants.\n\nDoes the UN Global Compact have teeth?\n======================================\n\nFocused on learning, dialogue and partnerships, the UN Global Compact is more like a guide dog than a watch dog. However, the UN Global Compact has a [mandatory disclosure framework](/participation/report)\n. Business participants are required to communicate their progress to their own stakeholders on an annual basis and to post a copy on the UN Global Compact's website. Failing to communicate progress on an annual basis results in a downgrading of participant status from active to non communicating. Participants who do not communicate progress for two years in a row are expelled and the UN Global Compact publishes their name. Non-communicating companies can become active participants by posting their Communication on Progress (CoP). Companies that have been expelled need to reapply to join the UN Global Compact. Their application must be accompanied by their CoP.\n\nIsn't there a danger of companies using UN logos and their affiliation with the UN and the UN Global Compact to \"blue-wash\" their operations that might actually be harming society?\n====================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact has developed its own logo, which is used frequently in official documents and publications. The use of the UN Global Compact image is strictly regulated and the same restrictions apply to its use as the general United Nations logo. Those policies are contained in the [UN Business Guidelines](http://business.un.org/en/documents/5292)\n published by the UN.\n\nIn addition the UN Global Compact has adopted a set of [integrity measures](/about/integrity-measures)\n to safeguard the initiative and to avoid potential abuse. They require companies to communicate their progress to their own stakeholders on an annual basis and to post a copy on the UN Global Compact's website. Failing to communicate progress on an annual basis results in a downgrading of participant status from active to non communicating. Participants who do not communicate progress for two years in a row are expelled and the UN Global Compact publishes their name.\n\nShould we report our progress on workplace related issues not addressed by the labour principles under \"labour\" or \"human rights\"?\n==================================================================================================================================\n\nSince the labour principles are also internationally proclaimed human rights, companies can choose whether to report on progress on working conditions and other labour issues under the heading of human rights or labour.\n\nHow does the UN Global Compact compare to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises?\n============================================================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises are two of the foremost voluntary initiatives that promote sustainable business practices. The initiatives complement each other in the goal of creating a more responsible and accountable corporate sector, yet are also distinct and unique. They have complementary engagement and accountability mechanisms. Together they define and enhance the relationship between businesses and international standards, in addition to providing a comprehensive model for responsible business practices today.

This decision recognizes that tobacco products are in direct conflict with UN goals, particularly with the right to public health, and undermines the achievement of SDG 3. This product-based exclusion is strictly limited to companies that produce and/or manufacture tobacco or are part of a joint venture, have a subsidiary or affiliate stake in a company that produces and/or manufactures tobacco. It does not apply to: sale and distribution of tobacco; production, sale and distribution of tobacco-related products (including filters, packaging, chemicals such as acetate used in tobacco filters); financing of tobacco or tobacco-related products through investment portfolios. See [here](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/about_the_gc/Integrity_measures/integrity-recommendation-2017.pdf)\n for more information.\n\nTo see how this exclusionary criteria applies to subsidiaries please see [here](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/about_the_gc/policy/UNGlobalCompact_SubsidiaryPolicy.pdf)\n.\n\n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nHelp us transform the world through business\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[Contribute Today](/about/foundation)\n\n[Sign Up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nHave a Question?\n----------------\n\n[Frequently Asked Questions](/about/faq)\n  \n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nFollow Us\n---------\n\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n     [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UNGlobalCompact)\n     [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact)\n     [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/globalcompact)\n     [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvGxh25-RUvCcZJXHj32Zzg)\n     [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ungc)\n     [RSS](http://feeds.unglobalcompact.org/UnitedNationsGlobalCompact-LatestNews)\n    \n\nQuickLinks\n----------\n\n*   [The Ten Principles](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n    \n*   [Sustainable Development Goals](/sdgs)\n    \n*   [Our Participants](/what-is-gc/participants)\n    \n*   [All Our Work](/what-is-gc/our-work/all)\n    \n*   [What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n    \n*   [Careers & Opportunities](/about/opportunities)\n    \n*   [Join Now](/join-us)\n    \n*   [Prepare your CoP](/participation/report/cop)\n    \n\n[Tweets by @globalcompact](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n\n*   [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/)\n    \n*   [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n    \n*   [Cookies Policy](/privacy-policy/cookies_notice)\n    \n*   [Copyright](/copyright)\n    \n*   [Photo Credits](/photo-credits)\n    \n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n×\n\nThis website uses cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best experience when using our website.  With your permission, we also set performance and functionality cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies and social media cookies.  You can click “Accept all” below if you are happy for us to place cookies (you can always change your mind later).  For more information please see our [Cookie Policy](https://unglobalcompact.org/privacy-policy)\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nSave & Close\n\nAccept all\n\nDecline all\n\nShow details Hide details\n\nCookie declaration\n\nAbout cookies\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nStrictly necessary cookies allow core website functionality such as user login and account management.

As a participant of the UN Global Compact, a company:\n\n*   Sets in motion changes to business operations so that the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles become part of strategy, culture and day-to-day operations;\n*   Is expected to publicly advocate the UN Global Compact and its principles via communications vehicles such as press releases, speeches, etc; and\n*   Is required to communicate with their stakeholders on an annual basis about progress in:\n    1.  Implementing the Ten Principles and\n    2.  Efforts to support societal priorities.\n\nThe [Communication on Progress](/participation/report/cop)\n (CoP) is a visible expression of your commitment to sustainability and your stakeholders can view it on your company’s profile page. Companies that fail to report or to meet the criteria over time may be removed from the initiative.\n\nThere are a number of ways that companies can take action to embed corporate sustainability into their DNA. [Find out what you can do](/take-action/action)\n.\n\nWho can join the UN Global Compact?\n===================================\n\nParticipation in the UN Global Compact is open to any company that is serious about its commitment to work towards implementation of the UN Global Compact principles throughout its operations and sphere of influence, and to communicate on its progress.\n\nProperly constituted (under prevailing national law) companies from any industry sector are eligible for participation, except those companies that meet the following exclusionary criteria:\n\n*   Subject to a UN sanction\n*   Listed on the UN Ineligible Vendors List for ethical reasons\n*   Derive revenue from the production, sale and/or transfer of antipersonnel landmines or cluster bombs\n*   Derive revenue from the production and/or manufacture of tobacco\n\nThe exclusionary criteria were updated on 12 September 2017. [See here for more information](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/about_the_gc/Integrity_measures/integrity-recommendation-2017.pdf)\n.\n\nHow can non-governmental organizations and other non-business participants get involved?\n========================================================================================\n\nAs equal partners and important stakeholders, civil society and other non-business organisations can participate through a number of UN Global Compact engagement mechanisms, including policy dialogues, learning, [Local Networks](/engage-locally)\n and [partnership projects](/take-action/partnerships)\n. In these areas, such organizations have a crucial role to play in helping to foster partnerships and produce substantive action. Non-business participants are also encouraged to commit their organization to the ten principles and to report on progress made within their organization. [More information about non-business participation in the UN Global Compact](/participation/join/who-should-join/non-business)\n.\n\nIs the UN Global Compact legally binding?\n=========================================\n\nNo. The UN Global Compact is a purely voluntary initiative. It does not police or enforce the behaviour or actions of companies. Rather, it is designed to stimulate change and to promote corporate sustainability and encourage innovative solutions and partnerships.\n\nIs the UN Global Compact a substitute for existing regulatory approaches?\n=========================================================================\n\nNo. The UN Global Compact views itself as complementing other voluntary initiatives and regulatory approaches by helping to establish the business case for human rights, labour standards, environmental stewardship and the fight against corruption. The UN Global Compact is a purely voluntary initiative designed to promote innovation in relation to corporate sustainability. Many of the existing standards support the principles of the UN Global Compact and are therefore are quite consistent with its overall objectives.\n\nWhy should a company that has already established its own code of conduct participate in the UN Global Compact?\n===============================================================================================================\n\nCorporate codes of conduct are extremely important and many companies have demonstrated leadership and positive change through their development and implementation. The UN Global Compact is not a code of conduct. Rather, it offers a policy framework for organizing and developing corporate sustainability strategies while offering a platform — based on universal principles — to encourage innovative initiatives and partnerships with civil society, Governments and other stakeholders\n\nAre there any financial obligations in becoming a UN Global Compact participant?\n================================================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact is a voluntary initiative, not a formal membership organization. Upon joining the UN Global Compact, larger companies are required to make an annual contribution to support their engagement in the UN Global Compact. These contributions support both our global and country-level operations and, by agreement, are split between the global secretariat and Local Networks.\n\nGlobal contributions are received, administered and distributed through the Foundation for the Global Compact – a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization – and are therefore tax deductible in many jurisdictions. Learn more about our [Finances](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/about/finances)\n.\n\nI operate an organization with less than 10 employees. Can I still participate in the UN Global Compact?\n========================================================================================================\n\nAs of 1 January 2018, we began revising our criteria to accept applications from companies and organizations with fewer than ten direct employees.\n\nStarting in January 2020, the UN Global Compact will accept all businesses and organizations that fulfill the criteria for participation, regardless of the number of employees. All participating companies and organizations are still required to have at least one direct employee and active operations.\n\nCan company subsidiaries join the UN Global Compact?\n====================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact applies the leadership principle. If the CEO of a company's global parent (holding, group, etc.) embraces the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact by sending a letter to the UN Secretary-General, the UN Global Compact will post only the name of the parent company on the global list assuming that all subsidiaries participate as well. Subsidiaries that wish to directly send a letter to the UN Secretary-General to underline their commitment, whether alongside the parent company or individually, will be listed as participants, and are invited to actively participate in our activities at the global and local level, including through becoming active in the Global Compact Local Network of their host country. To learn more about how subsidiaries can join the UN Global Compact see [here](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/about_the_gc/policy/UNGlobalCompact_SubsidiaryPolicy.pdf)\n.\n\nWhat if my company chooses to no longer participate in the UN Global Compact?\n=============================================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact is a voluntary initiative, and signatories are free to end their participation at any time. Participants may decide to withdraw if they determine they are not in a position to continue their participation in the initiative or if they are unable to uphold their commitment to the Ten Principles. The intention to withdraw should be communicated in writing by an authorized representative of the participating company/organization and specify the reasons for ending the commitment.\n\nAs a result of the request to withdraw, the participant’s status on the UN Global Compact website will be updated to “de-listed” and the reason for delisting will indicate “Participant requested withdrawal”.  \n\nIf there is no monitoring or enforcement, how does the UN Global Compact know that a company is truthfully portraying its actions?\n==================================================================================================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact is not a performance or assessment tool. It does not provide a seal of approval, nor does it make judgments on performance.\n\nParticipants are expected to publish in their annual report or similar corporate report (e.g. sustainability report) a description of the ways in which they are supporting the UN Global Compact and its ten principles. This is known as the [Communication on Progress](/participation/report/cop)\n. The UN Global Compact believes that this sort of openness and transparency encourages improved practices by participants.\n\nDoes the UN Global Compact have teeth?\n======================================\n\nFocused on learning, dialogue and partnerships, the UN Global Compact is more like a guide dog than a watch dog. However, the UN Global Compact has a [mandatory disclosure framework](/participation/report)\n. Business participants are required to communicate their progress to their own stakeholders on an annual basis and to post a copy on the UN Global Compact's website. Failing to communicate progress on an annual basis results in a downgrading of participant status from active to non communicating. Participants who do not communicate progress for two years in a row are expelled and the UN Global Compact publishes their name. Non-communicating companies can become active participants by posting their Communication on Progress (CoP). Companies that have been expelled need to reapply to join the UN Global Compact. Their application must be accompanied by their CoP.\n\nIsn't there a danger of companies using UN logos and their affiliation with the UN and the UN Global Compact to \"blue-wash\" their operations that might actually be harming society?\n====================================================================================================================================================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact has developed its own logo, which is used frequently in official documents and publications. The use of the UN Global Compact image is strictly regulated and the same restrictions apply to its use as the general United Nations logo. Those policies are contained in the [UN Business Guidelines](http://business.un.org/en/documents/5292)\n published by the UN.\n\nIn addition the UN Global Compact has adopted a set of [integrity measures](/about/integrity-measures)\n to safeguard the initiative and to avoid potential abuse. They require companies to communicate their progress to their own stakeholders on an annual basis and to post a copy on the UN Global Compact's website. Failing to communicate progress on an annual basis results in a downgrading of participant status from active to non communicating. Participants who do not communicate progress for two years in a row are expelled and the UN Global Compact publishes their name.\n\nShould we report our progress on workplace related issues not addressed by the labour principles under \"labour\" or \"human rights\"?\n==================================================================================================================================\n\nSince the labour principles are also internationally proclaimed human rights, companies can choose whether to report on progress on working conditions and other labour issues under the heading of human rights or labour.\n\nHow does the UN Global Compact compare to the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises?\n============================================================================================\n\nThe UN Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises are two of the foremost voluntary initiatives that promote sustainable business practices. The initiatives complement each other in the goal of creating a more responsible and accountable corporate sector, yet are also distinct and unique. They have complementary engagement and accountability mechanisms. Together they define and enhance the relationship between businesses and international standards, in addition to providing a comprehensive model for responsible business practices today.

This decision recognizes that tobacco products are in direct conflict with UN goals, particularly with the right to public health, and undermines the achievement of SDG 3. This product-based exclusion is strictly limited to companies that produce and/or manufacture tobacco or are part of a joint venture, have a subsidiary or affiliate stake in a company that produces and/or manufactures tobacco. It does not apply to: sale and distribution of tobacco; production, sale and distribution of tobacco-related products (including filters, packaging, chemicals such as acetate used in tobacco filters); financing of tobacco or tobacco-related products through investment portfolios. See [here](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/about_the_gc/Integrity_measures/integrity-recommendation-2017.pdf)\n for more information.\n\nTo see how this exclusionary criteria applies to subsidiaries please see [here](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/about_the_gc/policy/UNGlobalCompact_SubsidiaryPolicy.pdf)\n.\n\n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nHelp us transform the world through business\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[Contribute Today](/about/foundation)\n\n[Sign Up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nHave a Question?\n----------------\n\n[Frequently Asked Questions](/about/faq)\n  \n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nFollow Us\n---------\n\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n     [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UNGlobalCompact)\n     [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact)\n     [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/globalcompact)\n     [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvGxh25-RUvCcZJXHj32Zzg)\n     [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ungc)\n     [RSS](http://feeds.unglobalcompact.org/UnitedNationsGlobalCompact-LatestNews)\n    \n\nQuickLinks\n----------\n\n*   [The Ten Principles](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n    \n*   [Sustainable Development Goals](/sdgs)\n    \n*   [Our Participants](/what-is-gc/participants)\n    \n*   [All Our Work](/what-is-gc/our-work/all)\n    \n*   [What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n    \n*   [Careers & Opportunities](/about/opportunities)\n    \n*   [Join Now](/join-us)\n    \n*   [Prepare your CoP](/participation/report/cop)\n    \n\n[Tweets by @globalcompact](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n\n*   [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/)\n    \n*   [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n    \n*   [Cookies Policy](/privacy-policy/cookies_notice)\n    \n*   [Copyright](/copyright)\n    \n*   [Photo Credits](/photo-credits)\n    \n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n×\n\nThis website uses cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best experience when using our website.  With your permission, we also set performance and functionality cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies and social media cookies.  You can click “Accept all” below if you are happy for us to place cookies (you can always change your mind later).  For more information please see our [Cookie Policy](https://unglobalcompact.org/privacy-policy)\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nSave & Close\n\nAccept all\n\nDecline all\n\nShow details Hide details\n\nCookie declaration\n\nAbout cookies\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nStrictly necessary cookies allow core website functionality such as user login and account management.

Compact\n===========================================\n\nCorporate sustainability starts with a company’s value system and a principles-based approach to doing business. This means operating in ways that, at a minimum, meet fundamental responsibilities in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Responsible businesses enact the same values and principles wherever they have a presence, and know that good practices in one area do not offset harm in another. By incorporating the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact into strategies, policies and procedures, and establishing a culture of integrity, companies are not only upholding their basic responsibilities to people and planet, but also setting the stage for long-term success.\n\nThe Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact are derived from: the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)\n, the [International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work](http://www.ilo.org/declaration/lang--en/index.htm)\n, the [Rio Declaration on Environment and Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/rio20/futurewewant)\n, and the [United Nations Convention Against Corruption](http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html)\n.\n\nHuman Rights\n------------\n\n[Principle 1](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-1)\n: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and\n\n[Principle 2](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-2)\n: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.\n\nLabour  \n\n---------\n\n[Principle 3](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-3)\n: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining;\n\n[Principle 4](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-4)\n: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour;\n\n[Principle 5](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-5)\n: the effective abolition of child labour; and\n\n[Principle 6](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-6)\n: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nEnvironment  \n\n--------------\n\n[Principle 7](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-7)\n: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges;\n\n[Principle 8](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-8)\n: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and\n\n[Principle 9](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-9)\n: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.\n\nAnti-Corruption  \n\n------------------\n\n[Principle 10](/what-is-gc/mission/principles/principle-10)\n: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.\n\n[Join the UN Global

Compact is committed to protecting the privacy of our Participants, event attendees and website users. This privacy policy applies to all websites and mobile applications linking to or posting this privacy policy (each a “**Site**”).\n\n**1) Purpose of this privacy policy**\n\nThis privacy policy describes how we use, store, disclose, and process personal information that we obtain through any of our Sites, including information that you may provide in connection with a letter of commitment and online application to become a Participant of the UN Global Compact (together, an “**Application**”), or that we obtain when you attend a UN Global Compact event, request content or otherwise through the course of our operations.\n\nOur Sites are not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect personal information relating to children. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your children have provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.\n\nIt is important that you read this privacy policy together with any other privacy policy or fair processing policy we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your information.\n\nThe term “personal information” as used in this privacy policy shall mean any information that enables us to identify an individual, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as name, identification number, location data, online identifier or one or more factors specific to the individual.\n\n**2) Who we are**\n\nThis privacy policy is issued on behalf of the UN Global Compact and the Foundation for the Global Compact (from now on \"**we**\", \"**us**\" or \"**our**\").

Contact data is provided when you register for or attend one of our events, when you request content from our Sites or when you otherwise communicate with us using the “Contact Us” page on our Sites or via email.  Organizations also provide contact data when submitting Applications to become a Participant of the UN Global Compact.\n*   **Credentials**, such as passwords, secret question and answer, or similar security information used for authentication and account access. \n*   **Marketing and subscription data**, such as your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties, and your interests when you subscribe to email subscriptions on our Sites. \n*   **Event data**, such as the contact data you provide when you register for an event, and a record of your participation in our events as an attendee, presenter or a member of the press.\n*   **Survey information**, such as the contact data and content you provide when you respond to surveys or our requests for public comments, and a record of your participation in groups, forums or task forces that we organize or sponsor. \n*   **Invoicing information**, such as invoice data and bank account details to process payments.\n*   **Candidate data**, such as employment history, qualifications, academic qualifications and education records, and any other information that you provide to us when applying for a role, for example in your curriculum vitae, a covering letter, on an application form or during an interview, or that we have received from a recruitment agency or background check provider.  \n*   When you contact us directly via email, we use the personal information provided in your email to respond to your questions or comments. We may also store your comments for future reference.\n\n**b) Information we collect**\n\nBy accessing the Sites certain information about the user, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, navigation through the Site, the software used and the time spent, along with other similar information, will be stored on our servers. These will not specifically identify the user. We also may collect any telephone number from which you contact us.\n\nAt this time, our Sites do not support “do not track” signals (“**DNT**”) that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information. If you turn on the DNT setting on your browser, our Sites are not currently capable of following whatever DNT preferences you set. For more information about DNT, visit [www.donottrack.us](http://www.donottrack.us)\n. \n\n**c) Cookies**\n\nWe use “cookies” and similar technologies on our Sites. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your device to help us improve your access to our Sites and identify repeat visitors to our Sites. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to provide a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Sites. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Sites. For more information, please see our [Cookie Notice](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/privacy-policy/cookies_notice)\n.\n\n**4) How we use information** \n\nWe process personal information for the purposes set out in this privacy policy only where we have a valid legal ground for doing so under applicable data protection law.

These third parties include our payment processing providers, website analytics companies, email service providers, IT service providers, conference call providers, events management providers, website developers, consultants, accountants, lawyers and other professional advisers and others service providers.\n\nWe will only transfer your personal information to trusted third parties who provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures governing the processing to be carried out and who can demonstrate a commitment to compliance with those measures.\n\nWe do not allow our third party service providers to use your personal information for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal information for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.\n\nWe may disclose personal information in response to a court order, subpoena, law enforcement proceeding, regulatory inquiry or as otherwise legally required. Such disclosure of personal information will be limited (a) to the extent necessary to comply with national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements or (b) by statute, government regulation or case law that creates conflicting obligations or explicit authorizations.\n\nAlso, we may share personal information in order to enforce or apply our terms and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Global Compact Networks, our Participants or Signatories, or others. This includes exchanging information with other organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.\n\nWe may also share aggregated or anonymous information that cannot identify you with third parties. For example, we may disclose the number of visitors to our Sites, attendees to our events, or the number of people who have downloaded content from our Sites.\n\n**6) How long we keep information**\n\nWe store personal information, in a form which permits us to identify individuals, for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which the personal information is processed. We use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements and rights, or if it is not technically and reasonably feasible to remove it. Otherwise, we will seek to delete personal information within a reasonable timeframe upon request.\n\n**7) Security**\n\nWe maintain commercially reasonable security measures to protect personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure and that are consistent with our operations and generally accepted industry standards. These measures include the implementation of technical, physical and administrative security safeguards.

This privacy policy applies to all websites and mobile applications linking to or posting this privacy policy (each a “**Site**”).\n\n**1) Purpose of this privacy policy**\n\nThis privacy policy describes how we use, store, disclose, and process personal information that we obtain through any of our Sites, including information that you may provide in connection with a letter of commitment and online application to become a Participant of the UN Global Compact (together, an “**Application**”), or that we obtain when you attend a UN Global Compact event, request content or otherwise through the course of our operations.\n\nOur Sites are not intended for children and we do not knowingly collect personal information relating to children. If you are a parent or guardian and you learn that your children have provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16 without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.\n\nIt is important that you read this privacy policy together with any other privacy policy or fair processing policy we may provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you so that you are fully aware of how and why we are using your information.\n\nThe term “personal information” as used in this privacy policy shall mean any information that enables us to identify an individual, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as name, identification number, location data, online identifier or one or more factors specific to the individual.\n\n**2) Who we are**\n\nThis privacy policy is issued on behalf of the UN Global Compact and the Foundation for the Global Compact (from now on \"**we**\", \"**us**\" or \"**our**\").

Contact data is provided when you register for or attend one of our events, when you request content from our Sites or when you otherwise communicate with us using the “Contact Us” page on our Sites or via email.  Organizations also provide contact data when submitting Applications to become a Participant of the UN Global Compact.\n*   **Credentials**, such as passwords, secret question and answer, or similar security information used for authentication and account access. \n*   **Marketing and subscription data**, such as your preferences in receiving marketing from us and our third parties, and your interests when you subscribe to email subscriptions on our Sites. \n*   **Event data**, such as the contact data you provide when you register for an event, and a record of your participation in our events as an attendee, presenter or a member of the press.\n*   **Survey information**, such as the contact data and content you provide when you respond to surveys or our requests for public comments, and a record of your participation in groups, forums or task forces that we organize or sponsor. \n*   **Invoicing information**, such as invoice data and bank account details to process payments.\n*   **Candidate data**, such as employment history, qualifications, academic qualifications and education records, and any other information that you provide to us when applying for a role, for example in your curriculum vitae, a covering letter, on an application form or during an interview, or that we have received from a recruitment agency or background check provider.  \n*   When you contact us directly via email, we use the personal information provided in your email to respond to your questions or comments. We may also store your comments for future reference.\n\n**b) Information we collect**\n\nBy accessing the Sites certain information about the user, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses, navigation through the Site, the software used and the time spent, along with other similar information, will be stored on our servers. These will not specifically identify the user. We also may collect any telephone number from which you contact us.\n\nAt this time, our Sites do not support “do not track” signals (“**DNT**”) that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information. If you turn on the DNT setting on your browser, our Sites are not currently capable of following whatever DNT preferences you set. For more information about DNT, visit [www.donottrack.us](http://www.donottrack.us)\n. \n\n**c) Cookies**\n\nWe use “cookies” and similar technologies on our Sites. A cookie is a piece of data stored on your device to help us improve your access to our Sites and identify repeat visitors to our Sites. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not have to provide a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Sites.

\n\nCookies Policy\n==============\n\n_Last update: May 2018_\n\nThank you for visiting the website of the United Nations Global Compact (“UNGC,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). Your privacy is valued and respected by UNGC. Like most organizations, we employ “cookies” or similar technologies. This cookie notice tells you about the use of Cookies and similar technologies on our websites (the \"Sites\").\n\nWhen you first access our Sites from certain jurisdictions, you will receive a message advising you that cookies and similar technologies are in use. By clicking “accept cookies”, closing the message, or continuing to browse the Sites, you signify that you understand and agree to the use of these technologies, as described in this cookie notice.\n\nYou do not have to accept cookies and consent can be withdrawn at any time (see Section 3) 3, How to Control Cookies, below). You can change your browser settings to refuse or restrict cookies, and you may delete them after they have been placed on your device at any time. If you do not accept or delete our cookies, some areas of our Sites that you access may take more time to work, or may not function properly.\n\n**1) What are cookies?**\n\nCookies are small files containing a string of characters which we may store on your computer or mobile device when you visit one of our Sites. When you visit the Site again, the cookies allow us to recognize your browser. Cookies may store your preferences and other information but cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.\n\nCookies set by a website owner (in this case, UNGC) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Sites (i.e. advertising, social media functions and analytics).\n\n**2) The Cookies We Use**\n\nCookies make the use of our Sites easier by, among other things, saving your preferences. We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests. Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Sites to Personal Information that you previously submitted.\n\nThe information that we collect with cookies allows us to statistically analyze usage of our Sites, and to improve and customize our content and other offerings. However, we only disclose information collected with cookies to third parties on an aggregated basis without the use of any information that personally identifies you.\n\nThe specific types of first party and third party cookies placed by our Sites and the purposes they perform are described below:\n\n*   **Strictly Necessary Cookies.** These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Sites. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our websites or make use of e-billing services.\n*   **Performance and Functionality Cookies.** These are used to recognize you when you return to our Sites. This enables us to personalize our content for you and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region), but are non-essential to the performance of the Sites.\n*   **Analytical or Customization Cookies.** These cookies collect information about how users access and move through the Sites. We use this information in either aggregate form to help us to improve the way our Sites work, or to personalize our Sites to your interests.\n*   **Social Media Cookies.** These cookies allow us to integrate social media functions into our Sites.\n\n**3) How to Control Cookies**\n\nWhen you first access our Sites, you will receive a message advising you that cookies and similar technologies are in use. By clicking “accept cookies”, closing the message, or continuing to browse the Sites, you signify that you understand and agree to the use of these technologies, as described in this cookie notice.\n\nYou do not have to accept cookies and consent can be withdrawn at any time, although you may not be able to use certain features on the Sites. You can do this by activating the settings on your browser that allows you to refuse all or some cookies.  \nPlease follow the links below to helpful information for the most popular browsers:\n\n• [Microsoft Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)\n  \n• [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)\n  \n• [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)\n  \n• [Apple Safari](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21411?locale=en_US)\n\nIn addition, you can exercise advertising cookie choices by visiting:  \n• [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)\n,  \n• [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)\n; or  \n• [http://youronlinechoices.com/](http://youronlinechoices.com/)\n.\n\n**4) Web Beacons**\n\nAs well as cookies, we use other technologies to recognize and track visitors to our Sites. A web beacon (also known as a “tracking pixel” or “clear GIF”) is a clear graphic image (typically a one-pixel tag) that is delivered through a web browser or HTML e-mail, typically in conjunction with a cookie.\n\nWeb beacons allow us, for example, to monitor how users move from one page within our websites to another, to track access to our communications, to understand whether users have come to our websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to measure how content has been viewed and to improve Site performance.\n\n**5) Changes to this privacy notice**\n\nWe reserve the right to update or modify this cookie notice from time to time, with any such changes to be effective prospectively. Please visit this web page periodically so that you will be apprised of any such changes.

Your privacy is valued and respected by UNGC. Like most organizations, we employ “cookies” or similar technologies. This cookie notice tells you about the use of Cookies and similar technologies on our websites (the \"Sites\").\n\nWhen you first access our Sites from certain jurisdictions, you will receive a message advising you that cookies and similar technologies are in use. By clicking “accept cookies”, closing the message, or continuing to browse the Sites, you signify that you understand and agree to the use of these technologies, as described in this cookie notice.\n\nYou do not have to accept cookies and consent can be withdrawn at any time (see Section 3) 3, How to Control Cookies, below). You can change your browser settings to refuse or restrict cookies, and you may delete them after they have been placed on your device at any time. If you do not accept or delete our cookies, some areas of our Sites that you access may take more time to work, or may not function properly.\n\n**1) What are cookies?**\n\nCookies are small files containing a string of characters which we may store on your computer or mobile device when you visit one of our Sites. When you visit the Site again, the cookies allow us to recognize your browser. Cookies may store your preferences and other information but cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.\n\nCookies set by a website owner (in this case, UNGC) are called “first party cookies”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Sites (i.e. advertising, social media functions and analytics).\n\n**2) The Cookies We Use**\n\nCookies make the use of our Sites easier by, among other things, saving your preferences. We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests. Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Sites to Personal Information that you previously submitted.\n\nThe information that we collect with cookies allows us to statistically analyze usage of our Sites, and to improve and customize our content and other offerings. However, we only disclose information collected with cookies to third parties on an aggregated basis without the use of any information that personally identifies you.\n\nThe specific types of first party and third party cookies placed by our Sites and the purposes they perform are described below:\n\n*   **Strictly Necessary Cookies.** These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Sites. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our websites or make use of e-billing services.\n*   **Performance and Functionality Cookies.** These are used to recognize you when you return to our Sites. This enables us to personalize our content for you and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region), but are non-essential to the performance of the Sites.\n*   **Analytical or Customization Cookies.** These cookies collect information about how users access and move through the Sites. We use this information in either aggregate form to help us to improve the way our Sites work, or to personalize our Sites to your interests.\n*   **Social Media Cookies.** These cookies allow us to integrate social media functions into our Sites.\n\n**3) How to Control Cookies**\n\nWhen you first access our Sites, you will receive a message advising you that cookies and similar technologies are in use. By clicking “accept cookies”, closing the message, or continuing to browse the Sites, you signify that you understand and agree to the use of these technologies, as described in this cookie notice.\n\nYou do not have to accept cookies and consent can be withdrawn at any time, although you may not be able to use certain features on the Sites. You can do this by activating the settings on your browser that allows you to refuse all or some cookies.  \nPlease follow the links below to helpful information for the most popular browsers:\n\n• [Microsoft Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)\n  \n• [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)\n  \n• [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences)\n  \n• [Apple Safari](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21411?locale=en_US)\n\nIn addition, you can exercise advertising cookie choices by visiting:  \n• [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/)\n,  \n• [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)\n; or  \n• [http://youronlinechoices.com/](http://youronlinechoices.com/)\n.\n\n**4) Web Beacons**\n\nAs well as cookies, we use other technologies to recognize and track visitors to our Sites. A web beacon (also known as a “tracking pixel” or “clear GIF”) is a clear graphic image (typically a one-pixel tag) that is delivered through a web browser or HTML e-mail, typically in conjunction with a cookie.\n\nWeb beacons allow us, for example, to monitor how users move from one page within our websites to another, to track access to our communications, to understand whether users have come to our websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to measure how content has been viewed and to improve Site performance.\n\n**5) Changes to this privacy notice**\n\nWe reserve the right to update or modify this cookie notice from time to time, with any such changes to be effective prospectively.

and How\n=====================\n\nFor businesses to succeed, they require access to energy, good governance and sustainable economic development, among other fundamental factors. These same underlying needs overlap with public sector priorities underpinning peace, security and poverty reduction. Companies can do a great deal to address these common interests and create long-term value.  \n\nAdopting responsible business practices and committing to sustainability in their own operations is the first step. But tackling some of the toughest global challenges can’t be achieved by one company or sector alone. Working in partnership can often lead to greater impact. With its reach and unique capabilities, business can be a powerful source of innovation and implementation power. The business community can work alongside the public sector to develop more integrated solutions to global challenges.\n\n[How to partner: learn how we can help](/take-action/partnerships/how-to-partner)\n\n![Partnership Stats](https://d306pr3pise04h.cloudfront.net/uploads/e8/e8726af890bacd97ce2623cd93e2eacd6c0260c8---Partnerships_stats.png)\n\nFinding Partners\n================\n\nThe UN Global Compact provides opportunities for collaboration among UN, business and civil society stakeholders. We help you find and work together with stakeholders with common interests and comparative advantages.  \n\n**Partnering with the UN** enables your business to benefit from the credibility, know-how, experience and global reach of many UN specialized Agencies, Funds and Programmes. Partnering with the UN also helps you advance a key UN Global Compact objective: taking action in support of UN issues and goals. Learn more on [how the UN Global Compact works with the United Nations System](/about/un-business-agenda)\n.\n\n**Partnering with business** can help the UN innovate and improve operations. The UN also benefits from sector-specific knowledge from businesses of all sizes. Companies also may offer new management techniques that can help the UN improve efficiency and scale up solutions to global development challenges. Business partnerships can also help create growth and new market opportunities.\n\n**Partnering with Civil Society Organizations** (CSOs) can help increase the credibility and relevance of your sustainability initiatives. CSOs often bring profound knowledge of global development challenges and can leverage strong relationships with influential local stakeholders.\n\n[Find Partners](https://businesspartnershiphub.org/)\n\nThe Impact of Partnerships\n==========================\n\nPartnering with diverse types of organizations can help you generate innovative solutions and have an impact far beyond what you can accomplish alone.\n\nMany of the UN Global Compact’s success stories come from the effective partnerships we’ve helped participants establish. For example, partnerships helped make platforms, such as Caring for Climate, the CEO Water Mandate, the Women’s Empowerment Principles and Business for Peace, into models for translating global frameworks into local action across sectors. These partnerships demonstrate the great potential of working together to drive innovation and impact, advance the sustainable development agenda and address other major global challenges.\n\n[![Jeffrey Sachs Speech](https://d306pr3pise04h.cloudfront.net/uploads/cc/cc26ea815fb47aea420fd313741d84ccbf818fd3---Partnerships_video.png)](/library/4681)\n\nHelp us transform the world through business\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[Contribute Today](/about/foundation)\n\n[Sign Up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nHave a Question?\n----------------\n\n[Frequently Asked Questions](/about/faq)\n  \n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nFollow Us\n---------\n\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n     [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UNGlobalCompact)\n     [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact)\n     [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/globalcompact)\n     [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvGxh25-RUvCcZJXHj32Zzg)\n     [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ungc)\n     [RSS](http://feeds.unglobalcompact.org/UnitedNationsGlobalCompact-LatestNews)\n    \n\nQuickLinks\n----------\n\n*   [The Ten Principles](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n    \n*   [Sustainable Development Goals](/sdgs)\n    \n*   [Our Participants](/what-is-gc/participants)\n    \n*   [All Our Work](/what-is-gc/our-work/all)\n    \n*   [What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n    \n*   [Careers & Opportunities](/about/opportunities)\n    \n*   [Join Now](/join-us)\n    \n*   [Prepare your CoP](/participation/report/cop)\n    \n\n[Tweets by @globalcompact](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n\n*   [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/)\n    \n*   [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n    \n*   [Cookies Policy](/privacy-policy/cookies_notice)\n    \n*   [Copyright](/copyright)\n    \n*   [Photo Credits](/photo-credits)\n    \n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n×\n\nThis website uses cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best experience when using our website.  With your permission, we also set performance and functionality cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies and social media cookies.  You can click “Accept all” below if you are happy for us to place cookies (you can always change your mind later).  For more information please see our [Cookie Policy](https://unglobalcompact.org/privacy-policy)\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nSave & Close\n\nAccept all\n\nDecline all\n\nShow details Hide details\n\nCookie declaration\n\nAbout cookies\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nStrictly necessary cookies allow core website functionality such as user login and account management.

These same underlying needs overlap with public sector priorities underpinning peace, security and poverty reduction. Companies can do a great deal to address these common interests and create long-term value.  \n\nAdopting responsible business practices and committing to sustainability in their own operations is the first step. But tackling some of the toughest global challenges can’t be achieved by one company or sector alone. Working in partnership can often lead to greater impact. With its reach and unique capabilities, business can be a powerful source of innovation and implementation power. The business community can work alongside the public sector to develop more integrated solutions to global challenges.\n\n[How to partner: learn how we can help](/take-action/partnerships/how-to-partner)\n\n![Partnership Stats](https://d306pr3pise04h.cloudfront.net/uploads/e8/e8726af890bacd97ce2623cd93e2eacd6c0260c8---Partnerships_stats.png)\n\nFinding Partners\n================\n\nThe UN Global Compact provides opportunities for collaboration among UN, business and civil society stakeholders. We help you find and work together with stakeholders with common interests and comparative advantages.  \n\n**Partnering with the UN** enables your business to benefit from the credibility, know-how, experience and global reach of many UN specialized Agencies, Funds and Programmes. Partnering with the UN also helps you advance a key UN Global Compact objective: taking action in support of UN issues and goals. Learn more on [how the UN Global Compact works with the United Nations System](/about/un-business-agenda)\n.\n\n**Partnering with business** can help the UN innovate and improve operations. The UN also benefits from sector-specific knowledge from businesses of all sizes. Companies also may offer new management techniques that can help the UN improve efficiency and scale up solutions to global development challenges. Business partnerships can also help create growth and new market opportunities.\n\n**Partnering with Civil Society Organizations** (CSOs) can help increase the credibility and relevance of your sustainability initiatives. CSOs often bring profound knowledge of global development challenges and can leverage strong relationships with influential local stakeholders.\n\n[Find Partners](https://businesspartnershiphub.org/)\n\nThe Impact of Partnerships\n==========================\n\nPartnering with diverse types of organizations can help you generate innovative solutions and have an impact far beyond what you can accomplish alone.\n\nMany of the UN Global Compact’s success stories come from the effective partnerships we’ve helped participants establish. For example, partnerships helped make platforms, such as Caring for Climate, the CEO Water Mandate, the Women’s Empowerment Principles and Business for Peace, into models for translating global frameworks into local action across sectors. These partnerships demonstrate the great potential of working together to drive innovation and impact, advance the sustainable development agenda and address other major global challenges.\n\n[![Jeffrey Sachs Speech](https://d306pr3pise04h.cloudfront.net/uploads/cc/cc26ea815fb47aea420fd313741d84ccbf818fd3---Partnerships_video.png)](/library/4681)\n\nHelp us transform the world through business\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[Contribute Today](/about/foundation)\n\n[Sign Up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nHave a Question?\n----------------\n\n[Frequently Asked Questions](/about/faq)\n  \n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nFollow Us\n---------\n\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n     [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UNGlobalCompact)\n     [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact)\n     [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/globalcompact)\n     [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvGxh25-RUvCcZJXHj32Zzg)\n     [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ungc)\n     [RSS](http://feeds.unglobalcompact.org/UnitedNationsGlobalCompact-LatestNews)\n    \n\nQuickLinks\n----------\n\n*   [The Ten Principles](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n    \n*   [Sustainable Development Goals](/sdgs)\n    \n*   [Our Participants](/what-is-gc/participants)\n    \n*   [All Our Work](/what-is-gc/our-work/all)\n    \n*   [What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n    \n*   [Careers & Opportunities](/about/opportunities)\n    \n*   [Join Now](/join-us)\n    \n*   [Prepare your CoP](/participation/report/cop)\n    \n\n[Tweets by @globalcompact](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n\n*   [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/)\n    \n*   [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n    \n*   [Cookies Policy](/privacy-policy/cookies_notice)\n    \n*   [Copyright](/copyright)\n    \n*   [Photo Credits](/photo-credits)\n    \n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n×\n\nThis website uses cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best experience when using our website.  With your permission, we also set performance and functionality cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies and social media cookies.  You can click “Accept all” below if you are happy for us to place cookies (you can always change your mind later).  For more information please see our [Cookie Policy](https://unglobalcompact.org/privacy-policy)\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nSave & Close\n\nAccept all\n\nDecline all\n\nShow details Hide details\n\nCookie declaration\n\nAbout cookies\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nStrictly necessary cookies allow core website functionality such as user login and account management.

At the heart of “Agenda 2030” are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which clearly define the world we want — applying to all nations and leaving no one behind.\n\nThe new Global Goals result from a process that has been more inclusive than ever, with Governments involving business, civil society and citizens from the outset. We are all in agreement on where the world needs to go. Fulfilling these ambitions will take an unprecedented effort by all sectors in society — and business has to play a very important role in the process.\n\n[More about Sustainable Development](/what-is-gc/our-work/sustainable-development)\n\n[![](https://d306pr3pise04h.cloudfront.net/uploads/e7/e79ab747ba58d5018a6a40166c9d948c8e845509---sdg-tile-01.jpg)](/sdgs/17-global-goals)\n\nAll Companies Can Play a Role\n=============================\n\nNo matter how large or small, and regardless of their industry, all companies can contribute to the SDGs. While the scale and scope of the global goals is unprecedented, the fundamental ways that business can contribute remain unchanged. The UN Global Compact asks companies to first do business responsibly and then pursue opportunities to solve societal challenges through business innovation and collaboration.\n\nGlobal challenges – ranging from climate, water and food crises, to poverty, conflict and inequality – are in need of solutions that the private sector can deliver, representing a large and growing market for business innovation. In the rush to transform business models and systems for the future, integrity and values will have a huge role to play. For companies wanting to advance the SDG agenda, the job starts by acting responsibly – incorporating the [Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n widely into strategies and operations, and understanding that good practices or innovation in one area cannot make up for doing harm in another.\n\n[See What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n\n[![](https://d306pr3pise04h.cloudfront.net/uploads/71/717e24b047da9ec57d96e0b123a3896922416b67---act-responsibly-find-opps-thumb.png)](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/pics/un_images/site/Act-Responsibly-Find-Opportunities.pdf)\n\nHow the UN Global Compact Helps\n===============================\n\nThrough our [Making Global Goals Local Business](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/sdgs)\n campaign, we are spreading the word that companies that do business responsibly and find opportunities to innovate around sustainability will be the business leaders of tomorrow. To move from awareness to action, the UN Global Compact offers participants an [extensive toolbox](/sdgs/sdg-toolbox)\n including [next-generation solutions platforms](/sdgs/sdg-solutions-platforms)\n, an online [UN Business Action](https://business.un.org/)\n Hub and [resources](/library)\n that will help your business take action to achieve the SDGs.\n\nWhile the SDGs are universal, they will very much be addressed at the national level. As countries establish and enact national plans for achieving the SDGs, the Global Compact’s [Local Networks in over 85 countries](/sdgs/ln-action-plan)\n provide the platform for business to engage with stakeholders from Government, the UN, civil society and communities to map a shared approach.\n\n[Join the UN Global Compact](/participation/join/application)\n\n[![](https://d306pr3pise04h.cloudfront.net/uploads/cd/cd615ecfdcd3fee7fe51b34328ee501a4cd1db98---toolbox-02.jpg)](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/sdgs/sdg-toolbox)\n\nFrom our Library\n================\n\n*   [![](https://unglobalcompact.org/ungc-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/resources/images/4321/show@2x/MGGLB-2019.jpg?1570477564)\\\n    \\\n    Making Global Goals Local Business: Responsible business in the era of the Sustainable Development Goals\\\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\\n    \\\n    Report](/library/4321)\n    \n*   [![](https://unglobalcompact.org/ungc-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/resources/images/5041/show@2x/2018_Toolbox_Cover.JPG?1496938350)\\\n    \\\n    UN Global Compact 2018 Toolbox\\\n    ------------------------------\\\n    \\\n    Report](/library/5041)\n    \n*   [![](https://unglobalcompact.org/ungc-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/resources/images/3101/show@2x/thumb-01.png?1475249974)\\\n    \\\n    The SDG Compass\\\n    ---------------\\\n    \\\n    Report](/library/3101)\n    \n\nHelp us transform the world through business\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[Contribute Today](/about/foundation)\n\n[Sign Up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nHave a Question?\n----------------\n\n[Frequently Asked Questions](/about/faq)\n  \n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nFollow Us\n---------\n\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n     [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UNGlobalCompact)\n     [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact)\n     [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/globalcompact)\n     [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvGxh25-RUvCcZJXHj32Zzg)\n     [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ungc)\n     [RSS](http://feeds.unglobalcompact.org/UnitedNationsGlobalCompact-LatestNews)\n    \n\nQuickLinks\n----------\n\n*   [The Ten Principles](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n    \n*   [Sustainable Development Goals](/sdgs)\n    \n*   [Our Participants](/what-is-gc/participants)\n    \n*   [All Our Work](/what-is-gc/our-work/all)\n    \n*   [What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n    \n*   [Careers & Opportunities](/about/opportunities)\n    \n*   [Join Now](/join-us)\n    \n*   [Prepare your CoP](/participation/report/cop)\n    \n\n[Tweets by @globalcompact](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n\n*   [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/)\n    \n*   [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n    \n*   [Cookies Policy](/privacy-policy/cookies_notice)\n    \n*   [Copyright](/copyright)\n    \n*   [Photo Credits](/photo-credits)\n    \n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n×\n\nThis website uses cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best experience when using our website.  With your permission, we also set performance and functionality cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies and social media cookies.  You can click “Accept all” below if you are happy for us to place cookies (you can always change your mind later).  For more information please see our [Cookie Policy](https://unglobalcompact.org/privacy-policy)\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nSave & Close\n\nAccept all\n\nDecline all\n\nShow details Hide details\n\nCookie declaration\n\nAbout cookies\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nStrictly necessary cookies allow core website functionality such as user login and account management.

At the heart of “Agenda 2030” are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which clearly define the world we want — applying to all nations and leaving no one behind.\n\nThe new Global Goals result from a process that has been more inclusive than ever, with Governments involving business, civil society and citizens from the outset. We are all in agreement on where the world needs to go. Fulfilling these ambitions will take an unprecedented effort by all sectors in society — and business has to play a very important role in the process.\n\n[More about Sustainable Development](/what-is-gc/our-work/sustainable-development)\n\n[![](https://d306pr3pise04h.cloudfront.net/uploads/e7/e79ab747ba58d5018a6a40166c9d948c8e845509---sdg-tile-01.jpg)](/sdgs/17-global-goals)\n\nAll Companies Can Play a Role\n=============================\n\nNo matter how large or small, and regardless of their industry, all companies can contribute to the SDGs. While the scale and scope of the global goals is unprecedented, the fundamental ways that business can contribute remain unchanged. The UN Global Compact asks companies to first do business responsibly and then pursue opportunities to solve societal challenges through business innovation and collaboration.\n\nGlobal challenges – ranging from climate, water and food crises, to poverty, conflict and inequality – are in need of solutions that the private sector can deliver, representing a large and growing market for business innovation. In the rush to transform business models and systems for the future, integrity and values will have a huge role to play. For companies wanting to advance the SDG agenda, the job starts by acting responsibly – incorporating the [Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n widely into strategies and operations, and understanding that good practices or innovation in one area cannot make up for doing harm in another.\n\n[See What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n\n[![](https://d306pr3pise04h.cloudfront.net/uploads/71/717e24b047da9ec57d96e0b123a3896922416b67---act-responsibly-find-opps-thumb.png)](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/pics/un_images/site/Act-Responsibly-Find-Opportunities.pdf)\n\nHow the UN Global Compact Helps\n===============================\n\nThrough our [Making Global Goals Local Business](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/sdgs)\n campaign, we are spreading the word that companies that do business responsibly and find opportunities to innovate around sustainability will be the business leaders of tomorrow.

Development Goals (SDGs) and embodying the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. These individuals, known as SDG Pioneers, play a crucial role in inspiring action and showcasing the power of business to create a sustainable future for all.\n\nIn 2024, we are thrilled to embark on another journey to identify twelve SDG Pioneers from participating companies. These pioneers, regardless of their role, are setting ambitious SDG targets, expanding their impact, and championing a principles-based approach within their companies.\n\nThrough a rigorous selection process comprising both Local and Global Rounds, we will recognize individuals who exemplify dedication, innovation, and leadership in advancing the SDGs. \n\nJoin us in celebrating these champions of sustainability and learn how you can be part of the movement towards a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable world.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Apply Now:**<br><br>* * *<br><br>Are you an individual who actively drives initiatives aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within your company?<br><br>Do you strive to make a positive impact and promote sustainability in your work?<br><br>Are you committed to embodying the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact?<br><br>* * *<br><br>Check the list of participating countries to determine if your country is running a Local Round. | **Nominate Someone**<br><br>* * *<br><br>Do you know a colleague or peer who demonstrates exceptional dedication to advancing the SDGs?<br><br>Have you witnessed someone in your company setting ambitious SDG targets and driving meaningful change?<br><br>Are you aware of individuals who embody the principles of sustainability and corporate responsibility?<br><br>* * *<br><br>Can’t find your country?

Through their own company or by mobilizing other businesses, they are helping to reach one or more of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) while also contributing to business success.\n\nIn 2024, Networks spanning all continents will host country-level SDG Pioneers campaigns to identify Local Pioneers who will then be contenders for the Global Round to be recognized at the 2024 UN Global Compact Leaders Summit.\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nProfessionals working at any level of a UN Global Compact participating company are eligible to apply or be nominated. To check whether an organization is a UN Global Compact participating company, please search the participant list [online](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants)\n.\n\nFor the 2024 SDG Pioneers, we only consider companies who were participants of the UN Global Compact on October 1, 2023 and have submitted their 2024 Communication on Progress (CoP) within the reporting time frame of 1 April to 31 July.\n\nThe UN Global Compact reserves the right to remove the SDG Pioneer recognition if the company and/or individual is later deemed a reputational risk to the SDG Pioneer campaign and/or the UN Global Compact initiative.\n\nWhat if I am affiliated with but not directly employed by a UN Global Compact signatory?\n\nYou are only eligible to apply or be nominated if employed by the company (or its subsidiary).\n\nMy company does not yet participate in the UN Global Compact. Can I still apply?\n\nOnly individuals from UN Global Compact participating companies are eligible to apply or be nominated. If your company is not yet participating in the UN Global Compact, please visit the UN Global Compact [website](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/participation/join/application)\n website to learn more about how to join.\n\nWho can submit a nomination?\n\nYou can nominate a colleague at your company or someone you know from another UN Global Compact participating company. The UN Global Compact will then contact that individual and invite them to complete the SDG Pioneers application form.\n\nHow do I apply myself or nominate someone I think is doing great work?\n\nPlease complete the online application form, which is available [here](https://unglobalcompact.org/sdgs/sdgpioneers/nominate-yourself/new)\n. To nominate someone, click [here](https://unglobalcompact.org/sdgs/sdgpioneers/nomination-form/new)\n here.\n\nMy organization is doing great work. Can it be nominated?\n\nNo, the SDG Pioneers campaign highlights the work of individuals, not organizations.\n\nWhat is the nomination deadline?\n\nThe nomination deadline is **May 17, 2024**.\n\n### Selection Process\n\nHow will the SDG Pioneers be selected?\n\nA multi-stakeholder SDG Pioneers Selection Group will vote on the candidates. The SDG Pioneers Selection Group will comprise representatives from: Global Compact Network Board Members, UN, Government Representatives, Academia, and civil society.\n\nHow and when will I be notified if I am selected?\n\nThe Local SDG Pioneer will be informed of his/her selection before July 1st, 2024. This individual will then advance to the Global Round to compete. 2024 Global SDG Pioneers will be selected and recognized at the UN Global Compact Leaders Summit in September 2024. Due to the volume of nominations received, we may be unable to contact nominees who are not selected.\n\n### Recognition\n\nHow will the Local SDG Pioneers be recognized? What will I receive if selected?\n\nLocal Networks will recognize Local Pioneers for the great work that they have done to advance the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n2024 Global SDG Pioneers will be recognized at the UN Global Compact Leaders Summit in September 2024.\n\nI have more questions. Who can I contact?\n\nPlease email [sdgpioneers@unglobalcompact.org](mailto:sdgpioneers@unglobalcompact.org)\n with any additional questions.\n\nHelp us transform the world through business\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[Contribute Today](/about/foundation)\n\n[Sign Up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nHave a Question?\n----------------\n\n[Frequently Asked Questions](/about/faq)\n  \n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nFollow Us\n---------\n\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n     [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UNGlobalCompact)\n     [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact)\n     [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/globalcompact)\n     [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvGxh25-RUvCcZJXHj32Zzg)\n     [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ungc)\n     [RSS](http://feeds.unglobalcompact.org/UnitedNationsGlobalCompact-LatestNews)\n    \n\nQuickLinks\n----------\n\n*   [The Ten Principles](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n    \n*   [Sustainable Development Goals](/sdgs)\n    \n*   [Our Participants](/what-is-gc/participants)\n    \n*   [All Our Work](/what-is-gc/our-work/all)\n    \n*   [What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n    \n*   [Careers & Opportunities](/about/opportunities)\n    \n*   [Join Now](/join-us)\n    \n*   [Prepare your CoP](/participation/report/cop)\n    \n\n[Tweets by @globalcompact](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n\n*   [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/)\n    \n*   [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n    \n*   [Cookies Policy](/privacy-policy/cookies_notice)\n    \n*   [Copyright](/copyright)\n    \n*   [Photo Credits](/photo-credits)\n    \n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n×\n\nThis website uses cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best experience when using our website.  With your permission, we also set performance and functionality cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies and social media cookies.  You can click “Accept all” below if you are happy for us to place cookies (you can always change your mind later).  For more information please see our [Cookie Policy](https://unglobalcompact.org/privacy-policy)\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nSave & Close\n\nAccept all\n\nDecline all\n\nShow details Hide details\n\nCookie declaration\n\nAbout cookies\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nStrictly necessary cookies allow core website functionality such as user login and account management.

These pioneers, regardless of their role, are setting ambitious SDG targets, expanding their impact, and championing a principles-based approach within their companies.\n\nThrough a rigorous selection process comprising both Local and Global Rounds, we will recognize individuals who exemplify dedication, innovation, and leadership in advancing the SDGs. \n\nJoin us in celebrating these champions of sustainability and learn how you can be part of the movement towards a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable world.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Apply Now:**<br><br>* * *<br><br>Are you an individual who actively drives initiatives aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within your company?<br><br>Do you strive to make a positive impact and promote sustainability in your work?<br><br>Are you committed to embodying the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact?<br><br>* * *<br><br>Check the list of participating countries to determine if your country is running a Local Round. | **Nominate Someone**<br><br>* * *<br><br>Do you know a colleague or peer who demonstrates exceptional dedication to advancing the SDGs?<br><br>Have you witnessed someone in your company setting ambitious SDG targets and driving meaningful change?<br><br>Are you aware of individuals who embody the principles of sustainability and corporate responsibility?<br><br>* * *<br><br>Can’t find your country?

Through their own company or by mobilizing other businesses, they are helping to reach one or more of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) while also contributing to business success.\n\nIn 2024, Networks spanning all continents will host country-level SDG Pioneers campaigns to identify Local Pioneers who will then be contenders for the Global Round to be recognized at the 2024 UN Global Compact Leaders Summit.\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nProfessionals working at any level of a UN Global Compact participating company are eligible to apply or be nominated. To check whether an organization is a UN Global Compact participating company, please search the participant list [online](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants)\n.\n\nFor the 2024 SDG Pioneers, we only consider companies who were participants of the UN Global Compact on October 1, 2023 and have submitted their 2024 Communication on Progress (CoP) within the reporting time frame of 1 April to 31 July.\n\nThe UN Global Compact reserves the right to remove the SDG Pioneer recognition if the company and/or individual is later deemed a reputational risk to the SDG Pioneer campaign and/or the UN Global Compact initiative.\n\nWhat if I am affiliated with but not directly employed by a UN Global Compact signatory?\n\nYou are only eligible to apply or be nominated if employed by the company (or its subsidiary).\n\nMy company does not yet participate in the UN Global Compact. Can I still apply?\n\nOnly individuals from UN Global Compact participating companies are eligible to apply or be nominated. If your company is not yet participating in the UN Global Compact, please visit the UN Global Compact [website](https://www.unglobalcompact.org/participation/join/application)\n website to learn more about how to join.\n\nWho can submit a nomination?\n\nYou can nominate a colleague at your company or someone you know from another UN Global Compact participating company. The UN Global Compact will then contact that individual and invite them to complete the SDG Pioneers application form.\n\nHow do I apply myself or nominate someone I think is doing great work?\n\nPlease complete the online application form, which is available [here](https://unglobalcompact.org/sdgs/sdgpioneers/nominate-yourself/new)\n. To nominate someone, click [here](https://unglobalcompact.org/sdgs/sdgpioneers/nomination-form/new)\n here.\n\nMy organization is doing great work. Can it be nominated?\n\nNo, the SDG Pioneers campaign highlights the work of individuals, not organizations.\n\nWhat is the nomination deadline?\n\nThe nomination deadline is **May 17, 2024**.\n\n### Selection Process\n\nHow will the SDG Pioneers be selected?\n\nA multi-stakeholder SDG Pioneers Selection Group will vote on the candidates. The SDG Pioneers Selection Group will comprise representatives from: Global Compact Network Board Members, UN, Government Representatives, Academia, and civil society.\n\nHow and when will I be notified if I am selected?\n\nThe Local SDG Pioneer will be informed of his/her selection before July 1st, 2024. This individual will then advance to the Global Round to compete. 2024 Global SDG Pioneers will be selected and recognized at the UN Global Compact Leaders Summit in September 2024. Due to the volume of nominations received, we may be unable to contact nominees who are not selected.\n\n### Recognition\n\nHow will the Local SDG Pioneers be recognized? What will I receive if selected?\n\nLocal Networks will recognize Local Pioneers for the great work that they have done to advance the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n2024 Global SDG Pioneers will be recognized at the UN Global Compact Leaders Summit in September 2024.\n\nI have more questions. Who can I contact?\n\nPlease email [sdgpioneers@unglobalcompact.org](mailto:sdgpioneers@unglobalcompact.org)\n with any additional questions.\n\nHelp us transform the world through business\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[Contribute Today](/about/foundation)\n\n[Sign Up for Our Bulletin](/news/bulletin)\n\nHave a Question?\n----------------\n\n[Frequently Asked Questions](/about/faq)\n  \n[Contact Us](/about/contact)\n\nFollow Us\n---------\n\n*   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n     [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/UNGlobalCompact)\n     [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/united-nations-global-compact)\n     [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/globalcompact)\n     [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvGxh25-RUvCcZJXHj32Zzg)\n     [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ungc)\n     [RSS](http://feeds.unglobalcompact.org/UnitedNationsGlobalCompact-LatestNews)\n    \n\nQuickLinks\n----------\n\n*   [The Ten Principles](/what-is-gc/mission/principles)\n    \n*   [Sustainable Development Goals](/sdgs)\n    \n*   [Our Participants](/what-is-gc/participants)\n    \n*   [All Our Work](/what-is-gc/our-work/all)\n    \n*   [What You Can Do](/take-action/action)\n    \n*   [Careers & Opportunities](/about/opportunities)\n    \n*   [Join Now](/join-us)\n    \n*   [Prepare your CoP](/participation/report/cop)\n    \n\n[Tweets by @globalcompact](https://twitter.com/globalcompact)\n\n*   [United Nations](http://www.un.org/en/)\n    \n*   [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy)\n    \n*   [Cookies Policy](/privacy-policy/cookies_notice)\n    \n*   [Copyright](/copyright)\n    \n*   [Photo Credits](/photo-credits)\n    \n\n![](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/i/productlogos/translate/v14/24px.svg)\n\nOriginal text\n\nRate this translation\n\nYour feedback will be used to help improve Google Translate\n\n![](https://id.rlcdn.com/464526.gif)\n\n×\n\nThis website uses cookies\n\nWe use cookies to give you the best experience when using our website.  With your permission, we also set performance and functionality cookies, analytics cookies, advertising cookies and social media cookies.  You can click “Accept all” below if you are happy for us to place cookies (you can always change your mind later).  For more information please see our [Cookie Policy](https://unglobalcompact.org/privacy-policy)\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nSave & Close\n\nAccept all\n\nDecline all\n\nShow details Hide details\n\nCookie declaration\n\nAbout cookies\n\nStrictly necessary\n\nPerformance\n\nAnalytics\n\nFunctionality\n\nSocial media\n\nStrictly necessary cookies allow core website functionality such as user login and account management.
