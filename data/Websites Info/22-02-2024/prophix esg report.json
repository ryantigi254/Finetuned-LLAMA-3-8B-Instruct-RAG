end of the year. If you’ve dismissed it as just another acronym to look up later, you might be falling behind.\n\nESG and ESG reporting are becoming increasingly important, and some organizations will have to file their first ESG reports in 2024 and 2025.\n\nHere’s your guide to ESG reports—and how to prepare your own, including:\n\n*   [What is an ESG report?](#one)\n    \n*   [What should an ESG report include?](#two)\n    \n*   [Environmental criteria](#three)\n    \n*   [Social criteria](#four)\n    \n*   [Governance criteria](#five)\n    \n*   [ESG reporting standards](#six)\n    \n*   [ESG reporting frameworks](#seven)\n    \n*   [ESG scoring, research, and ratings](#eight)\n    \n*   [How ESG reporting varies by region](#nine)\n    \n*   [The best ESG report examples](#ten)\n    \n*   [FAQs about making an ESG report](#eleven)\n    \n*   [Conclusion: Create an ESG report with Prophix](#twelve)\n    \n\nWhat is an ESG report?\n----------------------\n\nESG (environment, social, and governance) reports are used by organizations to communicate the steps they’re taking to make positive changes in the environmental, social, and governance impact of their operations. While many organizations have long tried to show how they work to lessen their impact on the environment, advance civil rights, equality, and create governance policies that are fairer for all, a lack of benchmarks has made this difficult.\n\nWith ESG reporting—and the associated frameworks—organizations now have a common language for communicating this.\n\n### Who requires ESG reports?\n\nThis depends entirely on the jurisdiction your organization operates in. In some jurisdictions, organizations are legally required to submit ESG reports. These are developing requirements, with many companies needing to make their first ESG reports in 2024 or 2025.\n\nThe EU, for example, passed the [Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD](https://www.prophix.com/blog/a-guide-to-2024-esg-regulations-in-canada-across-the-globe/)\n) in early 2023, which makes ESG reporting mandatory for most organizations operating in Europe. Only companies with less than 10 employees or revenues below EUR 20 million are excluded.\n\nWhile not all jurisdictions enforce mandatory ESG reporting, the practice is becoming widespread worldwide. For instance, [99% of S&P 500 companies are reporting on ESG.](https://www.bdo.com/insights/sustainability-and-esg/99-of-the-s-p-500-is-reporting-on-esg-and-65-are-obtaining-esg-assurance#:~:text=Out%20of%20the%20500%20companies,the%20use%20of%20common%20standards.)\n  \n\nWhat should an ESG report include?\n----------------------------------\n\nAn ESG report needs to cover the environmental, social, and governance impacts of the organization’s operations. To that end, make sure your reports include the actions taken to address the following:  \n\n*   **Environmental:** Climate change, carbon emissions, biodiversity, as well as resource usage and procurement.\n*   **Social:** Promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, data protection and privacy, employee engagement, human rights, and labor standards.\n*   **Governance:** Internal controls, executive compensation, shareholder rights, lobbying, political involvement, whistleblower programs.\n\n### How to report non-financial information\n\nMany organizations have reporting on financial information down to a science but may not have processes in place for ESG reporting—especially with many standards being so new. But with a host of frameworks and guidelines already available, you don’t have to start from scratch. Here’s a step-by-step process for reporting on your ESG activities.  \n\n1.  Audit your organization for ESG objectives, processes, and achievements.\n2.  Identify the ESG standards your organization needs to abide by.\n    1.  [This will vary based on your jurisdiction, the size of your organization, and your activities.](https://www.prophix.com/blog/a-guide-to-2024-esg-regulations-in-canada-across-the-globe/)\n        \n3.  Pick an established ESG framework to base your report on.\n4.  Gather the necessary data from stakeholders.\n5.  Prepare reports, visualizations, and communication plans.\n6.  Get external input on your ESG report—and whether you’ve met the necessary requirements.\n\n### How to write an ESG report\n\nESG reports come in multiple formats, depending on who they’re being written for. If a regulatory body in your jurisdiction makes them mandatory, you’ll need to refer to their preferred framework before drafting your ESG report. From that framework, you can either create a template following the appropriate guidelines or use a pre-existing one. [This template from Invest Europe](https://www.investeurope.eu/invest-europe-esg-reporting-guidelines/esg-reporting-template/)\n, for example, shows what an ESG report would look like for a European company.  \n  \n\n![Prophix Image](https://www.prophix.com/images/uploads/icons/ESG-report.png \"ESG report\")\n\nYou should ensure that it lists all necessary ESG metrics as clearly as possible.\n\nIn jurisdictions where ESG reports aren’t mandatory, you have much more flexibility in how they’re created. You could include the following:  \n\n*   **ESG “balance sheet”:** Much like when public companies file quarterly earnings, you should have a balance sheet of sorts detailing all the ESG metrics you’re tracking and reporting on, especially if you can compare them against performance from previous years.\n*   **Write-ups from leaders:** While not all ESG reports need this, having a few paragraphs from your organization’s CEO and other influential leaders can help communicate your vision to investors.\n*   **Impactful slides:** Much like you would for a presentation, pull out data that’s particularly reflective of the strides you’ve made or the challenges you’ve had to face.\n\nHere are some examples of what you’d find in an ESG report, taken from [Nike’s FY22 Impact Report](https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/reports/fy22-nike-inc-impact-report)\n, which tracks the company’s performance across ESG metrics.\n\n![ESG metrics](https://www.prophix.com/images/uploads/icons/ESG-metrics.png \"ESG metrics\")\n\nsource: https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/reports/fy22-nike-inc-impact-report\n\nJust because you’re reporting on serious metrics doesn’t mean you can’t have impactful graphics the way you’d have in an external presentation. Remember that ESG reports are often used by investors to make better decisions, so you want to strike a balance between impact and thorough reporting.\n\n![ESG metrics](https://www.prophix.com/images/uploads/icons/ESG-metrics-2.png \"ESG metrics 2\")\n\nhttps://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/reports/fy22-nike-inc-impact-report\n\nWhen crafting ESG resorts, you’ll want to go into detail about how your actions have allowed you to meet ESG targets, and how your efforts have compared to previous years.\n\nEnvironmental criteria\n----------------------\n\nThe environmental criteria in ESG reports allow organizations to communicate the impact their operations have on the environment and the actions they’re taking to reduce these impacts. Here are the criteria involved:  \n\n*   ​​​Climate change\n    *   Carbon emissions\n    *   Product carbon footprint\n    *   Financing environmental impact\n    *   Climate change vulnerability\n*   Natural resources\n    *   Water stress\n    *   Biodiversity and land use\n    *   Raw material sourcing\n*   Pollution and waste\n    *   Toxic emissions and waste\n    *   Packaging material and waste\n    *   Electronic waste\n*   Environmental opportunity\n    *   Opportunities in clean tech\n    *   Opportunities in green building\n    *   Opportunities in renewable energy\n\n### Climate change\n\nHow is your company combating climate change? Keeping climate change top-of-mind is becoming increasingly important to consumers and investors alike.\n\nThis section of the report should include data regarding carbon emissions, product carbon footprint, climate change vulnerability, and financing environmental impact.\n\n### Natural resources\n\nReporting on your company’s natural resource usage is also crucial. Your ESG report should be detailed about raw material sourcing, biodiversity and land use, and water stress.\n\n### Pollution & Waste\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions is the most important data point in this section, but your report should also include more specific pollution data.\n\nIt’s also important to include information on toxic emissions and electronic waste, as well as information on company packaging material. Including how and where your company sources water is also key.\n\nThis section around waste and pollution will be highly scrutinized by those who value environmental ethics, so the data should be clear and thorough.\n\n### Environmental opportunities\n\nOpportunities are important to report on in any organization, but especially so if there’s significant room for improvement in your organization. No company is 100% environmentally conscious, so having identified clear plans to improve is going to look favorable on your report.\n\nIncluding areas of improvement around clean tech, green building, and renewable energy will make for a strong opportunities section.\n\nSocial criteria\n---------------\n\nThe social pillar in ESG covers how an organization manages relationships with its shareholders, employees, suppliers, and more. Here’s everything that falls within its scope:\n\n*   ​​​Human capital\n    *   Labor management\n    *   Health and safety\n    *   Human capital development\n    *   Supply chain labor standards\n*   Product liability\n    *   Product safety and quality\n    *   Chemical safety\n    *   Financial product safety\n    *   Privacy and data security\n    *   Responsible investment\n    *   Health risks\n*   Stakeholder opposition\n    *   Controversial sourcing\n*   Social opportunity\n    *   Access to communication\n    *   Access to finance\n    *   Access to health care\n    *   Opportunities in nutrition and health\n\n### Human capital\n\nWhen reporting on human capital, consider including data around labor management, health and safety, human capital development, and supply chain labor standards.\n\nHow easily, safely, and happily the employees and collaborators can work will be a crucial section of your ESG report. When consumers and investors think about “ethical companies” the treatment of employees will likely come to mind first, so ensuring clarity with your data here is key.\n\n### Product liability\n\nAnother way an organization affects people, both employees and consumers, is with their product. In general, reporting on responsible investment and financial product safety is a must.\n\nFor physical products, you’ll want to include information on product safety and quality, chemical safety, and other applicable health risks and considerations.\n\nFor digital products and services, include privacy and data security information.\n\n### Stakeholder opposition\n\nThe main thing to touch on under stakeholder opposition is controversial sourcing. Obtaining materials and goods associated with environmental, social, or ethical concerns is considered controversial sourcing.\n\n### Social opportunities\n\nMuch like the environmental section of your ESG report, you should also indicate social opportunities and areas of improvement.\n\nAn increasingly crucial part of the report centers around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). What is your company’s DEI plan, and what strides have they made in the organization?\n\nOther areas of opportunity should include social accessibility, like access to communication, finance, healthcare, and resources on nutrition and health.\n\nGovernance criteria\n-------------------\n\nThe corporate governance pillar of ESG refers to the policies and rules put in place to manage how an organization is controlled and directed. Here are the criteria that fall within this pillar:\n\n*   ​​​Corporate governance\n    *   Board diversity\n    *   Executive compensation\n    *   Ownership\n    *   Accounting\n*   Corporate behavior\n    *   Business ethics\n    *   Anti-competitive practices\n    *   Corruption and instability\n    *   Financial system instability\n    *   Tax transparency\n\n### Corporate governance\n\nStarting right at the top of the organization, your ESG report should include data on board diversity, ownership, and accounting.\n\nPay transparency is also becoming an ethical standard, so include data on executive compensation as well.\n\n### Corporate behavior\n\nThis is where your organization’s business ethics will be looked at closely. Anti-competitive practices, corruption and instability, financial system instability, and tax transparency are key points to report on.\n\n### Cybersecurity\n\nWhich security protocols and certifications does your organization meet? Applicable compliance points and areas of improvement are important to note here.  \n\nESG reporting frameworks\n------------------------\n\n### What is an ESG framework?\n\nAn ESG framework provides organizations with the guidelines they need to properly report on environment, social, and governance criteria. It serves as a set of benchmarks, a common tool for accurate communication with stakeholders, and a reference for best practices.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction it falls under, your organization may be subject to multiple ESG frameworks.\n\n### Climate Disclosures Standards Board (CDSB)\n\nFirst established in 2007, the [CDSB](https://www.cdsb.net/)\n provided one of the first frameworks for reporting on climate information. It has since been consolidated into the [IFRS foundation](https://www.prophix.com/blog/what-is-ifrs-accounting-and-why-should-finance-teams-care/)\n, centralizing its framework with other international accounting standards.\n\n### International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC)\n\nThe [IIRC](https://integratedreporting.ifrs.org/)\n is another example of an early ESG reporting framework that was consolidated with the [IFRS](https://www.prophix.com/blog/what-is-ifrs-accounting-and-why-should-finance-teams-care/)\n to centralize these standards. However, it’s still a powerful framework for organizations making ESG disclosures—especially if you’re in a jurisdiction that hasn’t yet established its own framework.\n\n### Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nThe [TCFD](https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/)\n was created by [the Financial Stability Board (FSB)](https://www.fsb.org/)\n in 2015 to facilitate the reporting of climate-related financial data. It’s since been disbanded, with the framework being integrated into the [IFRS foundation](https://www.prophix.com/blog/what-is-ifrs-accounting-and-why-should-finance-teams-care/)\n as it became part of global ESG standards.\n\nWhat is an ESG standard?\n------------------------\n\nESG standards go one step beyond ESG frameworks. Instead of just being guidelines for your organization to follow, they’re the metrics and requirements you need to abide by when creating compliant ESG reports. If a framework is a blueprint for what you’re building, the standard is the building code.\n\n### EFRAG Sustainability Reporting Board\n\nRelevant for European organizations needing to make ESG disclosures, the [EFRAG Sustainability Reporting Board](https://efrag.org/About/Governance/40/EFRAG-Sustainability-Reporting-Board?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1)\n makes recommendations to European institutions and authorities to establish sustainability reporting standards.\n\n### Global reporting initiative (GRI)\n\nIn operation for more than 25 years, [GRI](https://www.globalreporting.org/)\n creates and shares standards for reporting on biodiversity, tax, waste management, emissions, diversity, equality, and more.\n\n### International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\n\nFormed by the [IFRS](https://www.prophix.com/blog/what-is-ifrs-accounting-and-why-should-finance-teams-care/)\n in November of 2021, the [ISSB](https://www.ifrs.org/groups/international-sustainability-standards-board/)\n is one of the leaders in providing ESG reporting standards, having absorbed frameworks from other organizations to create a universal standard. The board is still working on these standards, making important strides in [emissions reporting](https://www.ifrs.org/news-and-events/news/2024/01/new-resource-on-emissions-reporting-using-gri-and-issb-standards/)\n, [global accessibility](https://www.ifrs.org/content/ifrs/home/news-and-events/news/2023/07/issb-consults-on-proposed-digital-taxonomy.html)\n, and more.\n\nESG scoring, research, and ratings\n----------------------------------\n\n### Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)\n\nThe CDP aims to measure the environmental impacts of investors, companies, cities, and governments. They’re a not-for-profit charity and run the global disclosure system, building a more sustainable economy for all.\n\n### Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)\n\nThe ISS provides objective shareholder meeting research and recommendations. They are global leaders in corporate governance and provide end-to-end workflow solutions and multiple voting policy choices for institutional investors.\n\n### Just Capital\n\nJust Capital ranks America’s most just companies by multiple criteria. They are the leading platform for reporting on, measuring, and improving corporate performance in the stakeholder economy.\n\n### Morningstar Sustainalytics\n\nSustainalytics, also known as Morningstar Sustainalytics, takes an organization's ESG data and provides an overall rating for investors to evaluate funds. The rating is a scale of 1-5 globes, with a one-globe rating being the weakest, and a five-globe rating the strongest.\n\n### MSCI\n\nThe Morgan Stanley Capital International rating assesses a company’s management of financially relevant ESG opportunities and risks. The MSCI looks at the long-term commitment to positive ESG scores and assigns a letter grade based on impact.\n\n### S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA)\n\nThe CSA is a yearly assessment of an organization’s sustainability practices. Founded in 1999, the CSA focuses on industry-specific criteria and awards a score from 0-100, with a score of 70 or more considered “good”.\n\n### S&P TruCost\n\nClimate change risks, natural resource usage, and broader ESG risks are assessed with S&P TruCost ratings.

end of the year. If you’ve dismissed it as just another acronym to look up later, you might be falling behind.\n\nESG and ESG reporting are becoming increasingly important, and some organizations will have to file their first ESG reports in 2024 and 2025.\n\nHere’s your guide to ESG reports—and how to prepare your own, including:\n\n*   [What is an ESG report?](#one)\n    \n*   [What should an ESG report include?](#two)\n    \n*   [Environmental criteria](#three)\n    \n*   [Social criteria](#four)\n    \n*   [Governance criteria](#five)\n    \n*   [ESG reporting standards](#six)\n    \n*   [ESG reporting frameworks](#seven)\n    \n*   [ESG scoring, research, and ratings](#eight)\n    \n*   [How ESG reporting varies by region](#nine)\n    \n*   [The best ESG report examples](#ten)\n    \n*   [FAQs about making an ESG report](#eleven)\n    \n*   [Conclusion: Create an ESG report with Prophix](#twelve)\n    \n\nWhat is an ESG report?\n----------------------\n\nESG (environment, social, and governance) reports are used by organizations to communicate the steps they’re taking to make positive changes in the environmental, social, and governance impact of their operations. While many organizations have long tried to show how they work to lessen their impact on the environment, advance civil rights, equality, and create governance policies that are fairer for all, a lack of benchmarks has made this difficult.\n\nWith ESG reporting—and the associated frameworks—organizations now have a common language for communicating this.\n\n### Who requires ESG reports?\n\nThis depends entirely on the jurisdiction your organization operates in. In some jurisdictions, organizations are legally required to submit ESG reports. These are developing requirements, with many companies needing to make their first ESG reports in 2024 or 2025.\n\nThe EU, for example, passed the [Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD](https://www.prophix.com/blog/a-guide-to-2024-esg-regulations-in-canada-across-the-globe/)\n) in early 2023, which makes ESG reporting mandatory for most organizations operating in Europe. Only companies with less than 10 employees or revenues below EUR 20 million are excluded.\n\nWhile not all jurisdictions enforce mandatory ESG reporting, the practice is becoming widespread worldwide. For instance, [99% of S&P 500 companies are reporting on ESG.](https://www.bdo.com/insights/sustainability-and-esg/99-of-the-s-p-500-is-reporting-on-esg-and-65-are-obtaining-esg-assurance#:~:text=Out%20of%20the%20500%20companies,the%20use%20of%20common%20standards.)\n  \n\nWhat should an ESG report include?\n----------------------------------\n\nAn ESG report needs to cover the environmental, social, and governance impacts of the organization’s operations. To that end, make sure your reports include the actions taken to address the following:  \n\n*   **Environmental:** Climate change, carbon emissions, biodiversity, as well as resource usage and procurement.\n*   **Social:** Promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, data protection and privacy, employee engagement, human rights, and labor standards.\n*   **Governance:** Internal controls, executive compensation, shareholder rights, lobbying, political involvement, whistleblower programs.\n\n### How to report non-financial information\n\nMany organizations have reporting on financial information down to a science but may not have processes in place for ESG reporting—especially with many standards being so new. But with a host of frameworks and guidelines already available, you don’t have to start from scratch. Here’s a step-by-step process for reporting on your ESG activities.  \n\n1.  Audit your organization for ESG objectives, processes, and achievements.\n2.  Identify the ESG standards your organization needs to abide by.\n    1.  [This will vary based on your jurisdiction, the size of your organization, and your activities.](https://www.prophix.com/blog/a-guide-to-2024-esg-regulations-in-canada-across-the-globe/)\n        \n3.  Pick an established ESG framework to base your report on.\n4.  Gather the necessary data from stakeholders.\n5.  Prepare reports, visualizations, and communication plans.\n6.  Get external input on your ESG report—and whether you’ve met the necessary requirements.\n\n### How to write an ESG report\n\nESG reports come in multiple formats, depending on who they’re being written for. If a regulatory body in your jurisdiction makes them mandatory, you’ll need to refer to their preferred framework before drafting your ESG report. From that framework, you can either create a template following the appropriate guidelines or use a pre-existing one. [This template from Invest Europe](https://www.investeurope.eu/invest-europe-esg-reporting-guidelines/esg-reporting-template/)\n, for example, shows what an ESG report would look like for a European company.  \n  \n\n![Prophix Image](https://www.prophix.com/images/uploads/icons/ESG-report.png \"ESG report\")\n\nYou should ensure that it lists all necessary ESG metrics as clearly as possible.\n\nIn jurisdictions where ESG reports aren’t mandatory, you have much more flexibility in how they’re created. You could include the following:  \n\n*   **ESG “balance sheet”:** Much like when public companies file quarterly earnings, you should have a balance sheet of sorts detailing all the ESG metrics you’re tracking and reporting on, especially if you can compare them against performance from previous years.\n*   **Write-ups from leaders:** While not all ESG reports need this, having a few paragraphs from your organization’s CEO and other influential leaders can help communicate your vision to investors.\n*   **Impactful slides:** Much like you would for a presentation, pull out data that’s particularly reflective of the strides you’ve made or the challenges you’ve had to face.\n\nHere are some examples of what you’d find in an ESG report, taken from [Nike’s FY22 Impact Report](https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/reports/fy22-nike-inc-impact-report)\n, which tracks the company’s performance across ESG metrics.\n\n![ESG metrics](https://www.prophix.com/images/uploads/icons/ESG-metrics.png \"ESG metrics\")\n\nsource: https://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/reports/fy22-nike-inc-impact-report\n\nJust because you’re reporting on serious metrics doesn’t mean you can’t have impactful graphics the way you’d have in an external presentation. Remember that ESG reports are often used by investors to make better decisions, so you want to strike a balance between impact and thorough reporting.\n\n![ESG metrics](https://www.prophix.com/images/uploads/icons/ESG-metrics-2.png \"ESG metrics 2\")\n\nhttps://about.nike.com/en/newsroom/reports/fy22-nike-inc-impact-report\n\nWhen crafting ESG resorts, you’ll want to go into detail about how your actions have allowed you to meet ESG targets, and how your efforts have compared to previous years.\n\nEnvironmental criteria\n----------------------\n\nThe environmental criteria in ESG reports allow organizations to communicate the impact their operations have on the environment and the actions they’re taking to reduce these impacts. Here are the criteria involved:  \n\n*   ​​​Climate change\n    *   Carbon emissions\n    *   Product carbon footprint\n    *   Financing environmental impact\n    *   Climate change vulnerability\n*   Natural resources\n    *   Water stress\n    *   Biodiversity and land use\n    *   Raw material sourcing\n*   Pollution and waste\n    *   Toxic emissions and waste\n    *   Packaging material and waste\n    *   Electronic waste\n*   Environmental opportunity\n    *   Opportunities in clean tech\n    *   Opportunities in green building\n    *   Opportunities in renewable energy\n\n### Climate change\n\nHow is your company combating climate change? Keeping climate change top-of-mind is becoming increasingly important to consumers and investors alike.\n\nThis section of the report should include data regarding carbon emissions, product carbon footprint, climate change vulnerability, and financing environmental impact.\n\n### Natural resources\n\nReporting on your company’s natural resource usage is also crucial. Your ESG report should be detailed about raw material sourcing, biodiversity and land use, and water stress.\n\n### Pollution & Waste\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions is the most important data point in this section, but your report should also include more specific pollution data.\n\nIt’s also important to include information on toxic emissions and electronic waste, as well as information on company packaging material. Including how and where your company sources water is also key.\n\nThis section around waste and pollution will be highly scrutinized by those who value environmental ethics, so the data should be clear and thorough.\n\n### Environmental opportunities\n\nOpportunities are important to report on in any organization, but especially so if there’s significant room for improvement in your organization. No company is 100% environmentally conscious, so having identified clear plans to improve is going to look favorable on your report.\n\nIncluding areas of improvement around clean tech, green building, and renewable energy will make for a strong opportunities section.\n\nSocial criteria\n---------------\n\nThe social pillar in ESG covers how an organization manages relationships with its shareholders, employees, suppliers, and more. Here’s everything that falls within its scope:\n\n*   ​​​Human capital\n    *   Labor management\n    *   Health and safety\n    *   Human capital development\n    *   Supply chain labor standards\n*   Product liability\n    *   Product safety and quality\n    *   Chemical safety\n    *   Financial product safety\n    *   Privacy and data security\n    *   Responsible investment\n    *   Health risks\n*   Stakeholder opposition\n    *   Controversial sourcing\n*   Social opportunity\n    *   Access to communication\n    *   Access to finance\n    *   Access to health care\n    *   Opportunities in nutrition and health\n\n### Human capital\n\nWhen reporting on human capital, consider including data around labor management, health and safety, human capital development, and supply chain labor standards.\n\nHow easily, safely, and happily the employees and collaborators can work will be a crucial section of your ESG report. When consumers and investors think about “ethical companies” the treatment of employees will likely come to mind first, so ensuring clarity with your data here is key.\n\n### Product liability\n\nAnother way an organization affects people, both employees and consumers, is with their product. In general, reporting on responsible investment and financial product safety is a must.\n\nFor physical products, you’ll want to include information on product safety and quality, chemical safety, and other applicable health risks and considerations.\n\nFor digital products and services, include privacy and data security information.\n\n### Stakeholder opposition\n\nThe main thing to touch on under stakeholder opposition is controversial sourcing. Obtaining materials and goods associated with environmental, social, or ethical concerns is considered controversial sourcing.\n\n### Social opportunities\n\nMuch like the environmental section of your ESG report, you should also indicate social opportunities and areas of improvement.\n\nAn increasingly crucial part of the report centers around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). What is your company’s DEI plan, and what strides have they made in the organization?\n\nOther areas of opportunity should include social accessibility, like access to communication, finance, healthcare, and resources on nutrition and health.\n\nGovernance criteria\n-------------------\n\nThe corporate governance pillar of ESG refers to the policies and rules put in place to manage how an organization is controlled and directed. Here are the criteria that fall within this pillar:\n\n*   ​​​Corporate governance\n    *   Board diversity\n    *   Executive compensation\n    *   Ownership\n    *   Accounting\n*   Corporate behavior\n    *   Business ethics\n    *   Anti-competitive practices\n    *   Corruption and instability\n    *   Financial system instability\n    *   Tax transparency\n\n### Corporate governance\n\nStarting right at the top of the organization, your ESG report should include data on board diversity, ownership, and accounting.\n\nPay transparency is also becoming an ethical standard, so include data on executive compensation as well.\n\n### Corporate behavior\n\nThis is where your organization’s business ethics will be looked at closely. Anti-competitive practices, corruption and instability, financial system instability, and tax transparency are key points to report on.\n\n### Cybersecurity\n\nWhich security protocols and certifications does your organization meet? Applicable compliance points and areas of improvement are important to note here.  \n\nESG reporting frameworks\n------------------------\n\n### What is an ESG framework?\n\nAn ESG framework provides organizations with the guidelines they need to properly report on environment, social, and governance criteria. It serves as a set of benchmarks, a common tool for accurate communication with stakeholders, and a reference for best practices.\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction it falls under, your organization may be subject to multiple ESG frameworks.\n\n### Climate Disclosures Standards Board (CDSB)\n\nFirst established in 2007, the [CDSB](https://www.cdsb.net/)\n provided one of the first frameworks for reporting on climate information. It has since been consolidated into the [IFRS foundation](https://www.prophix.com/blog/what-is-ifrs-accounting-and-why-should-finance-teams-care/)\n, centralizing its framework with other international accounting standards.\n\n### International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC)\n\nThe [IIRC](https://integratedreporting.ifrs.org/)\n is another example of an early ESG reporting framework that was consolidated with the [IFRS](https://www.prophix.com/blog/what-is-ifrs-accounting-and-why-should-finance-teams-care/)\n to centralize these standards. However, it’s still a powerful framework for organizations making ESG disclosures—especially if you’re in a jurisdiction that hasn’t yet established its own framework.\n\n### Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nThe [TCFD](https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/)\n was created by [the Financial Stability Board (FSB)](https://www.fsb.org/)\n in 2015 to facilitate the reporting of climate-related financial data. It’s since been disbanded, with the framework being integrated into the [IFRS foundation](https://www.prophix.com/blog/what-is-ifrs-accounting-and-why-should-finance-teams-care/)\n as it became part of global ESG standards.\n\nWhat is an ESG standard?\n------------------------\n\nESG standards go one step beyond ESG frameworks. Instead of just being guidelines for your organization to follow, they’re the metrics and requirements you need to abide by when creating compliant ESG reports. If a framework is a blueprint for what you’re building, the standard is the building code.\n\n### EFRAG Sustainability Reporting Board\n\nRelevant for European organizations needing to make ESG disclosures, the [EFRAG Sustainability Reporting Board](https://efrag.org/About/Governance/40/EFRAG-Sustainability-Reporting-Board?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1)\n makes recommendations to European institutions and authorities to establish sustainability reporting standards.\n\n### Global reporting initiative (GRI)\n\nIn operation for more than 25 years, [GRI](https://www.globalreporting.org/)\n creates and shares standards for reporting on biodiversity, tax, waste management, emissions, diversity, equality, and more.\n\n### International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB)\n\nFormed by the [IFRS](https://www.prophix.com/blog/what-is-ifrs-accounting-and-why-should-finance-teams-care/)\n in November of 2021, the [ISSB](https://www.ifrs.org/groups/international-sustainability-standards-board/)\n is one of the leaders in providing ESG reporting standards, having absorbed frameworks from other organizations to create a universal standard. The board is still working on these standards, making important strides in [emissions reporting](https://www.ifrs.org/news-and-events/news/2024/01/new-resource-on-emissions-reporting-using-gri-and-issb-standards/)\n, [global accessibility](https://www.ifrs.org/content/ifrs/home/news-and-events/news/2023/07/issb-consults-on-proposed-digital-taxonomy.html)\n, and more.\n\nESG scoring, research, and ratings\n----------------------------------\n\n### Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)\n\nThe CDP aims to measure the environmental impacts of investors, companies, cities, and governments. They’re a not-for-profit charity and run the global disclosure system, building a more sustainable economy for all.\n\n### Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)\n\nThe ISS provides objective shareholder meeting research and recommendations. They are global leaders in corporate governance and provide end-to-end workflow solutions and multiple voting policy choices for institutional investors.\n\n### Just Capital\n\nJust Capital ranks America’s most just companies by multiple criteria. They are the leading platform for reporting on, measuring, and improving corporate performance in the stakeholder economy.\n\n### Morningstar Sustainalytics\n\nSustainalytics, also known as Morningstar Sustainalytics, takes an organization's ESG data and provides an overall rating for investors to evaluate funds. The rating is a scale of 1-5 globes, with a one-globe rating being the weakest, and a five-globe rating the strongest.\n\n### MSCI\n\nThe Morgan Stanley Capital International rating assesses a company’s management of financially relevant ESG opportunities and risks. The MSCI looks at the long-term commitment to positive ESG scores and assigns a letter grade based on impact.\n\n### S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA)\n\nThe CSA is a yearly assessment of an organization’s sustainability practices. Founded in 1999, the CSA focuses on industry-specific criteria and awards a score from 0-100, with a score of 70 or more considered “good”.\n\n### S&P TruCost\n\nClimate change risks, natural resource usage, and broader ESG risks are assessed with S&P TruCost ratings. They are a global leader in carbon and environmental data and risk analysis.\n\n### Vigeo Eiris\n\nVigeo Eiris provides ESG services and research for organizations and investors, both public and private. They evaluate company strategies and operations around sustainability and how ingrained they are as consistent practices.\n\n### Internal ratings\n\nTo stay on top of ESG preparedness, companies often implement internal ESG scorecards that are routinely revisited. These scorecards evaluate the performance of the company based on the many intricacies of ESG criteria, to ensure a consistent organization-wide improvement.  \n\nHow ESG reporting varies by region\n----------------------------------\n\nNot sure if ESG reporting is mandatory in your jurisdiction? Need to know which framework you can refer to? Let’s do a quick roundup of some of the biggest jurisdictions and their ESG requirements.\n\n### USA\n\n**Mandatory or optional:** Not currently mandatory, but [96% of S&P 500 companies published an ESG report in 2022.](https://www.ga-institute.com/nc/storage/press-releases/article/new-ga-institute-research-shows-sustainability-reporting-by-largest-us-public-companies-reached-a.html)\n\n**Governing body**: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n**Preferred frameworks**: While there are no regulatory frameworks in the USA, some benchmark frameworks include the [Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)](https://www.cdp.net/en)\n and the [Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB)](https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/)\n.\n\n### Canada\n\n**Mandatory or optional:** While not currently mandatory for most organizations, by May 2024, some government agencies and private companies will have to report some elements that fall within ESG reporting, [such as the use of forced or child labor.](https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/practice-areas/esg/dawn-of-a-new-age-in-esg-disclosure/379640#:~:text=Mandatory%20ESG%20disclosure%20key%20dates%3A&text=September%202024%3A%20Public%20reporting%20deadline,by%20OSFI%20Guideline%20B-15)\n By the end of 2024, ESG reporting will be mandatory for more organizations, like [large banks and insurance companies.](https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/practice-areas/esg/dawn-of-a-new-age-in-esg-disclosure/379640#:~:text=Mandatory%20ESG%20disclosure%20key%20dates%3A&text=September%202024%3A%20Public%20reporting%20deadline,by%20OSFI%20Guideline%20B-15)\n\n**Governing body**: The Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB)\n\n**Preferred frameworks**: While there are no frameworks specific to Canada, the [Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)](https://www.globalreporting.org/)\n, [Sustainability Accounting Standards (SASB)](https://www.sasb.org/)\n, and the [Task Force of Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)](https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/)\n can be followed by Canadian companies.\n\n### UK\n\n**Mandatory or optional:** Currently mandatory for larger public companies, companies with more than 500 employees, or companies with more than £500 million in annual revenue.
