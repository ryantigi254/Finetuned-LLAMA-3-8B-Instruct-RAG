It incorporates regular face-to-face training, international cooperation training, and e-learning. It launched its own Academy that provides staff with access to different kinds of e-learning.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\n2030 Agenda Learning providing a general introduction into the 2030 Agenda and SDG s.\n\nSDG4: Quality education Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\n\nSDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nSDG17: Partnerships for the goals Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\nSDG 17: Systemic Issues\n\nSubject\n\nStatistical training\n\nKeywords\n\ne-learning\n\nstatistical training\n\nHCP Academy\n\nSDGs\n\nHigh Commission for Planning\n\nThe High Commission for Planning (HCP) is a public service organization founded in 2003, itâs the main producer of statistical, economic, demographic, and social information in Morocco. HCP is responsible for the preparation of quarterly and annual national accounts. The organization is also in charge of economic forecasts and prospective, socio-economic, and demographic studies.\n\nThe HCP attaches great importance to the continuous training of its staff to enhance their skills and improve their employability. In 2018, the HCP launched a new training strategy incorporating e-learning as a key component.\n\n**The HCPâs training strategy**\n\nWe have developed our training strategy by adopting a methodical approach ranging from defining specific objectives, assessing employee needs, defining training content and programs, choosing training modes and methods, mobilizing human and financial resources, and finally post-training evaluation.\n\n**Objectives**\n\nOur aim is to optimize the effectiveness of learning and improvement programs, promote the development of skills, and achieve desired outcomes. We view the training strategy as a guide for all individuals involved in the training process, ensuring that they remain in sync with the overarching goals and priorities.\n\n**Needs assessment**\n\nTo begin, we needed to properly determine the training requirements for the HCPâs staff. To achieve this, we gathered annual training needs from both central and regional entities. Additionally, we conducted a skills evaluation of over 250 managers and executives. We have also implemented a Â« Human Resource Planning Â» forward-looking jobs and skills management system for the next five years, focusing on anticipating future job demands and the skills required.\n\nThis approach has enabled us to determine the main areas of continuing training to be developed, which are:\n\n*   Statistics and data collection\n*   Planning and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n*   Economic modeling, forecasting, and foresight\n*   National Accounting\n*   IT and digital transformation tools\n*   Management\n*   Languages\n\n**Training modes and methods**\n\nTo achieve our goal of satisfying all of our staff's training needs, we have adopted a new training strategy based on the following three approaches\n\n1.  Face-to-face training\n2.  Training as part of International Cooperation\n3.  E-learning\n\n**Face-to-face training**\n\nWe draw up an annual face-to-face training plan to meet our employees' learning needs and minimize gaps in the skills required to carry out their mission. Our training courses cater to a diverse group of professionals, including operatives, technicians, supervisors, and managers. These courses cover a wide range of topics such as statistics, economics, sustainable development, information systems, and management. We collaborate with both internal HCP trainers and external experts to ensure the best learning experience. These training courses are organized on a regional and central level, with small groups of up to 20 people per module.\n\n**Training as part of International Cooperation**\n\nThe HCPâs staff participate in training workshops through international and regional partnerships, as well as bilateral projects with various organizations such as Medstat IV, Eurostat, INSEE, AFRISTAT, ESCAW, World Bank, BAD, ILO, AITRS, IMF, CEA, and others. The training courses have a specific focus on topics related to the implementation of new standards and methodologies like revised classifications, United Nations manuals, quality standards, and green economy, among others. Additionally, they cover the use of innovative statistical tools such as R Language, ERETES, and new technologies in production and dissemination processes including Big data and data visualization. The international cooperation training courses are tailored to meet the needs of country strategies and are adapted to the context of the recipients.\n\nThrough international cooperation, the training provided has evolved to become more diverse in terms of mode and coverage. This includes the adoption of online training, thematic coverage on topics such as SDGs and technology, and targeting executives from various regional departments such as gender, statistical processes, technological tools, and strategic planning. In 2022, a total of 95 managers were able to benefit from this international cooperation training.\n\n**HCPâs E-learning Strategy**\n\nSince 2018, HCP has been implementing a new e-learning strategy. HCPâs e-learning strategy has been launched as part of a digital transformation program for all of HCPâs business and management processes.\n\nThe first stage of this strategy was focused on introducing our staff to online training and certification. This was achieved by registering for MOOCs or training modules on various existing e-learning platforms. All HCP staff were provided with access to several MOOCs covering a range of topics, including statistics, economy, management, and information systems.\n\nThe second step involved developing our own e-learning platform, HCP Academy ([https://www.academy.hcp.ma/](https://www.academy.hcp.ma/)\n), which gives employees access to a range of MOOCs and e-learning materials, according to their needs, to develop their knowledge, skills, and professional know-how.\n\nWe have organized our e-learning platform's online content into eight categories: Economics and Statistics, Living Standards and Income, Population and Demographics, Sustainable Development, Management, Digital Transformation, Languages, and Census.\n\n  \nThe HCP Academy platform provides employees the opportunity to access training at any time, allowing them to learn at their own pace. It combines the flexibility and interaction of online learning with group dynamics, without worrying about logistical constraints. Initially, the platform was only available to HCP employees, but it will soon be open to national and international partners.\n\n[![HCP Academy - MOOC](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/HCP-Academy_MOOC.jpg)](https://www.academy.hcp.ma/)\n\n**_HCP Academy_** offers different training types:\n\n1.  _MOOCs_\n2.  _Webinars_\n3.  _Virtual Classes & Video Training_\n4.  _Face-to-face training management_\n\n[![HCP Academy_Search](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/HCP-Academy_Search.jpg)](https://www.academy.hcp.ma/all_courses)\n\n**What the _HCP Academy_ platform allows:**\n\n*   Boosts involvement and responsibility to evolve and increase efficiency;\n*   Flexible learning method thanks to the ability to access the platform at any time;\n*   Accessibility: training available all the time;\n*   Modularization allowing the individualization of courses;\n*   Reduced training time thanks to more precise, better-targeted content;\n*   Responsiveness with updating training content according to the evolution of needs and technologies;\n*   Quality: research and posting of high-quality online training content.\n\n**_Covid-19 impact on face-to-face training_**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a radical change in the way we work and learn.Â With lockdowns and social distancing protocols, remote work became the standard for numerous employees. They have adjusted to the digital workspace, utilizing video conferencing software for virtual meetings and digital platforms for collaboration.  \n  \nDue to the health emergency and containment measures implemented on March 20, 2020, HCP has decided to cancel all face-to-face training for the 2020 budget year. However, this has provided an opportunity to enhance our e-learning offerings. HCP employees now have access to a wide range of online training courses via various platforms such as FUN MOOCs, EDX, Coursera, MyMOOCs, etc. These courses cover a diverse range of topics including Leadership and Personal Development, Digital Transformation, Statistics, Data Analysis, Macroeconomics, Geographic Information Systems, IT, Informational Intelligence, Management, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n**_UN SDG - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)_**\n\nThe HCP provides training courses for its staff to enhance their understanding of the SDGs, and to gain insights into the ways in which the conceptual approach to these goals can promote innovation and transformation in data production and research for their programs. These courses also aim to help HCP staff comprehend the genesis and evolution of the concept of sustainable development and the SDGs, including their components, principles, values, and the modalities for monitoring and evaluating their implementation.\n\nFirst, the face-to-face sessions were organized following the themes below:\n\n*   Global framework: Concepts, major areas, and principles of sustainable development\n*   Genesis and evolution of the concept of sustainable development\n*   New concepts and major areas of sustainable development\n*   Guiding principles of sustainable development\n*   Sustainable development implementation process\n*   Millennium Development Goal: Reminder, assessment and overall assessment\n*   Focus on MDG 7: ensure a favorable environment\n*   Sustainable development objectives: components and global orientations\n*   Institutional mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of the SDGs\n*   Agenda 2063 for sustainable development in Africa: the Africa we want to\n*   Genesis and evolution of the concept of SDGs\n*   Components, values, and principles of SDGs\n*   Practical group work: contextualization of the SDGs, convergence of strategies with the SDGs and targets, indicator metadata\n\n**Using UN SDG:Learn Platform**\n\nWe have selected several MOOCs from the UN SDG:Learn Platform and integrated them into our HCP e-learning platform, \"HCP Academy\". This enables us to track the progress of each employee's online training and to provide personalized follow-up.\n\nthe main UNSDG: learn MOOCs followed by HCP executives are\n\n*   Introduction to Sustainable Development Goal indicators under FAO custodianship\n*   How to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals\n*   Gender, Environment and Sustainable Development\n*   Inclusive Growth - Climate Change\n*   Compiling national metadata for Sustainable Development Goals\n*   Macroeconomics for a Sustainable Planet\n*   Understanding data and statistics better â for more effective SDG decision-making\n\n[![HCP Academy_FAO course](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/HCP-Academy_FAO-course.jpg)](https://www.academy.hcp.ma/formation-details/282333644)\n\n**_Conclusion and trends_**\n\nThanks to HCP's e-learning strategy, we have been able to enhance our employees' skills and offer them a wide range of training resources that were not possible to provide in a traditional classroom setting. Additionally, this e-learning strategy has allowed us to offer tailored learning experiences, instant feedback, and data-based knowledge, leading to ongoing improvements and optimization.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the effectiveness of an e-learning strategy depends on a careful methodological approach, investment in both human resources and technology, ongoing evaluation, and adaptability. In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, it's essential to keep abreast of the latest developments and to incorporate feedback from learners and stakeholders.\n\nOur organization is moving forward with the third phase of our e-learning strategy. We plan to develop MOOCs with the help of our skilled trainers and e-learning engineering partners. Our latest project aims to create MOOCs that cater to participants of the census scheduled for September 2024.\n\nFinally, I can say that an e-learning strategy is a powerful tool for advancing education and training in the digital age. When thoughtfully designed and implemented, it has the potential to empower learners, stimulate organizational growth, and contribute to the success of individuals and institutions.\n\n_\\*Mr._Â _Samir Issara is the Director of Human Resources and General Affairs at the Haut-Commissariat au Plan (HCP).

strategy\n======================================================================\n\nMicrolearning\n\n ![UN SDG:Learn logo](https://www.unsdglearn.org/img/logo_sdglearn_white.svg) Blog\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n*   ![Samir Issara](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_fit_200_200/Samir-Issara-HCP.jpg) Samir Issara Director of Human Resources and General Affairs, High Commission for Planning of Morocco (HCP)\n\n![HCP Academy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/HCP-Academy.jpg)\n\nThe High Commission for Planning of Morocco (HCP) devised a smart training needs-based e-learning strategy. It incorporates regular face-to-face training, international cooperation training, and e-learning. It launched its own Academy that provides staff with access to different kinds of e-learning.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\n2030 Agenda Learning providing a general introduction into the 2030 Agenda and SDG s.\n\nSDG4: Quality education Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\n\nSDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nSDG17: Partnerships for the goals Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\nSDG 17: Systemic Issues\n\nSubject\n\nStatistical training\n\nKeywords\n\ne-learning\n\nstatistical training\n\nHCP Academy\n\nSDGs\n\nHigh Commission for Planning\n\nThe High Commission for Planning (HCP) is a public service organization founded in 2003, itâs the main producer of statistical, economic, demographic, and social information in Morocco. HCP is responsible for the preparation of quarterly and annual national accounts. The organization is also in charge of economic forecasts and prospective, socio-economic, and demographic studies.\n\nThe HCP attaches great importance to the continuous training of its staff to enhance their skills and improve their employability. In 2018, the HCP launched a new training strategy incorporating e-learning as a key component.\n\n**The HCPâs training strategy**\n\nWe have developed our training strategy by adopting a methodical approach ranging from defining specific objectives, assessing employee needs, defining training content and programs, choosing training modes and methods, mobilizing human and financial resources, and finally post-training evaluation.\n\n**Objectives**\n\nOur aim is to optimize the effectiveness of learning and improvement programs, promote the development of skills, and achieve desired outcomes. We view the training strategy as a guide for all individuals involved in the training process, ensuring that they remain in sync with the overarching goals and priorities.\n\n**Needs assessment**\n\nTo begin, we needed to properly determine the training requirements for the HCPâs staff. To achieve this, we gathered annual training needs from both central and regional entities. Additionally, we conducted a skills evaluation of over 250 managers and executives. We have also implemented a Â« Human Resource Planning Â» forward-looking jobs and skills management system for the next five years, focusing on anticipating future job demands and the skills required.\n\nThis approach has enabled us to determine the main areas of continuing training to be developed, which are:\n\n*   Statistics and data collection\n*   Planning and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n*   Economic modeling, forecasting, and foresight\n*   National Accounting\n*   IT and digital transformation tools\n*   Management\n*   Languages\n\n**Training modes and methods**\n\nTo achieve our goal of satisfying all of our staff's training needs, we have adopted a new training strategy based on the following three approaches\n\n1.  Face-to-face training\n2.  Training as part of International Cooperation\n3.  E-learning\n\n**Face-to-face training**\n\nWe draw up an annual face-to-face training plan to meet our employees' learning needs and minimize gaps in the skills required to carry out their mission. Our training courses cater to a diverse group of professionals, including operatives, technicians, supervisors, and managers. These courses cover a wide range of topics such as statistics, economics, sustainable development, information systems, and management. We collaborate with both internal HCP trainers and external experts to ensure the best learning experience. These training courses are organized on a regional and central level, with small groups of up to 20 people per module.\n\n**Training as part of International Cooperation**\n\nThe HCPâs staff participate in training workshops through international and regional partnerships, as well as bilateral projects with various organizations such as Medstat IV, Eurostat, INSEE, AFRISTAT, ESCAW, World Bank, BAD, ILO, AITRS, IMF, CEA, and others. The training courses have a specific focus on topics related to the implementation of new standards and methodologies like revised classifications, United Nations manuals, quality standards, and green economy, among others. Additionally, they cover the use of innovative statistical tools such as R Language, ERETES, and new technologies in production and dissemination processes including Big data and data visualization. The international cooperation training courses are tailored to meet the needs of country strategies and are adapted to the context of the recipients.\n\nThrough international cooperation, the training provided has evolved to become more diverse in terms of mode and coverage. This includes the adoption of online training, thematic coverage on topics such as SDGs and technology, and targeting executives from various regional departments such as gender, statistical processes, technological tools, and strategic planning. In 2022, a total of 95 managers were able to benefit from this international cooperation training.\n\n**HCPâs E-learning Strategy**\n\nSince 2018, HCP has been implementing a new e-learning strategy. HCPâs e-learning strategy has been launched as part of a digital transformation program for all of HCPâs business and management processes.\n\nThe first stage of this strategy was focused on introducing our staff to online training and certification. This was achieved by registering for MOOCs or training modules on various existing e-learning platforms. All HCP staff were provided with access to several MOOCs covering a range of topics, including statistics, economy, management, and information systems.\n\nThe second step involved developing our own e-learning platform, HCP Academy ([https://www.academy.hcp.ma/](https://www.academy.hcp.ma/)\n), which gives employees access to a range of MOOCs and e-learning materials, according to their needs, to develop their knowledge, skills, and professional know-how.\n\nWe have organized our e-learning platform's online content into eight categories: Economics and Statistics, Living Standards and Income, Population and Demographics, Sustainable Development, Management, Digital Transformation, Languages, and Census.\n\n  \nThe HCP Academy platform provides employees the opportunity to access training at any time, allowing them to learn at their own pace. It combines the flexibility and interaction of online learning with group dynamics, without worrying about logistical constraints. Initially, the platform was only available to HCP employees, but it will soon be open to national and international partners.\n\n[![HCP Academy - MOOC](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/HCP-Academy_MOOC.jpg)](https://www.academy.hcp.ma/)\n\n**_HCP Academy_** offers different training types:\n\n1.  _MOOCs_\n2.  _Webinars_\n3.  _Virtual Classes & Video Training_\n4.  _Face-to-face training management_\n\n[![HCP Academy_Search](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/HCP-Academy_Search.jpg)](https://www.academy.hcp.ma/all_courses)\n\n**What the _HCP Academy_ platform allows:**\n\n*   Boosts involvement and responsibility to evolve and increase efficiency;\n*   Flexible learning method thanks to the ability to access the platform at any time;\n*   Accessibility: training available all the time;\n*   Modularization allowing the individualization of courses;\n*   Reduced training time thanks to more precise, better-targeted content;\n*   Responsiveness with updating training content according to the evolution of needs and technologies;\n*   Quality: research and posting of high-quality online training content.\n\n**_Covid-19 impact on face-to-face training_**\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a radical change in the way we work and learn.Â With lockdowns and social distancing protocols, remote work became the standard for numerous employees. They have adjusted to the digital workspace, utilizing video conferencing software for virtual meetings and digital platforms for collaboration.  \n  \nDue to the health emergency and containment measures implemented on March 20, 2020, HCP has decided to cancel all face-to-face training for the 2020 budget year. However, this has provided an opportunity to enhance our e-learning offerings. HCP employees now have access to a wide range of online training courses via various platforms such as FUN MOOCs, EDX, Coursera, MyMOOCs, etc. These courses cover a diverse range of topics including Leadership and Personal Development, Digital Transformation, Statistics, Data Analysis, Macroeconomics, Geographic Information Systems, IT, Informational Intelligence, Management, and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n**_UN SDG - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)_**\n\nThe HCP provides training courses for its staff to enhance their understanding of the SDGs, and to gain insights into the ways in which the conceptual approach to these goals can promote innovation and transformation in data production and research for their programs. These courses also aim to help HCP staff comprehend the genesis and evolution of the concept of sustainable development and the SDGs, including their components, principles, values, and the modalities for monitoring and evaluating their implementation.\n\nFirst, the face-to-face sessions were organized following the themes below:\n\n*   Global framework: Concepts, major areas, and principles of sustainable development\n*   Genesis and evolution of the concept of sustainable development\n*   New concepts and major areas of sustainable development\n*   Guiding principles of sustainable development\n*   Sustainable development implementation process\n*   Millennium Development Goal: Reminder, assessment and overall assessment\n*   Focus on MDG 7: ensure a favorable environment\n*   Sustainable development objectives: components and global orientations\n*   Institutional mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of the SDGs\n*   Agenda 2063 for sustainable development in Africa: the Africa we want to\n*   Genesis and evolution of the concept of SDGs\n*   Components, values, and principles of SDGs\n*   Practical group work: contextualization of the SDGs, convergence of strategies with the SDGs and targets, indicator metadata\n\n**Using UN SDG:Learn Platform**\n\nWe have selected several MOOCs from the UN SDG:Learn Platform and integrated them into our HCP e-learning platform, \"HCP Academy\". This enables us to track the progress of each employee's online training and to provide personalized follow-up.\n\nthe main UNSDG: learn MOOCs followed by HCP executives are\n\n*   Introduction to Sustainable Development Goal indicators under FAO custodianship\n*   How to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals\n*   Gender, Environment and Sustainable Development\n*   Inclusive Growth - Climate Change\n*   Compiling national metadata for Sustainable Development Goals\n*   Macroeconomics for a Sustainable Planet\n*   Understanding data and statistics better â for more effective SDG decision-making\n\n[![HCP Academy_FAO course](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/HCP-Academy_FAO-course.jpg)](https://www.academy.hcp.ma/formation-details/282333644)\n\n**_Conclusion and trends_**\n\nThanks to HCP's e-learning strategy, we have been able to enhance our employees' skills and offer them a wide range of training resources that were not possible to provide in a traditional classroom setting. Additionally, this e-learning strategy has allowed us to offer tailored learning experiences, instant feedback, and data-based knowledge, leading to ongoing improvements and optimization.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that the effectiveness of an e-learning strategy depends on a careful methodological approach, investment in both human resources and technology, ongoing evaluation, and adaptability. In a rapidly evolving digital landscape, it's essential to keep abreast of the latest developments and to incorporate feedback from learners and stakeholders.\n\nOur organization is moving forward with the third phase of our e-learning strategy. We plan to develop MOOCs with the help of our skilled trainers and e-learning engineering partners. Our latest project aims to create MOOCs that cater to participants of the census scheduled for September 2024.\n\nFinally, I can say that an e-learning strategy is a powerful tool for advancing education and training in the digital age. When thoughtfully designed and implemented, it has the potential to empower learners, stimulate organizational growth, and contribute to the success of individuals and institutions.\n\n_\\*Mr._Â _Samir Issara is the Director of Human Resources and General Affairs at the Haut-Commissariat au Plan (HCP).

We need to make some hard choices based on comprehensive information of potential impacts across society.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nBreaking the silos Learning that deals with interconnected policies and actions cutting across several SDG s.\n\nSDG17: Partnerships for the goals Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\nSDG 17: Systemic Issues\n\nSubject\n\nPolicy Coherence in times of COVID-19\n\nKeywords\n\n2030 Agenda\n\nCOVID recovery\n\nCOVID-19\n\npolicy coherence\n\nSDGs\n\nIt is by now widely recognized that the SDGs came with a strong imperative for integrated decision making and coherence. Looking for example at the VNRs (Voluntary National Reviews) reported to the High-level Political Forum, each year the issue of institutional integration and coherence gets more and more attention. The most common way of approaching this, is to understand and tweak the central government machinery to become better integrated and conducive to knowledge-sharing and coordination between its various parts. This institutional integration process provides the basis for allowing a fuller picture of the whole landscape of priorities, goals, and ambitions, as well as enabling a balancing of policies to drive progress towards sustainable development.\n\nCase in point â this [UN strategy note](https://publicadministration.un.org/Portals/1/Strategy%20note%20coherent%20policymaking%20Mar%202021.pdf)\n I helped prepare a few months ago, which presents some key organizational options and approaches for governments to promote coherent policy making.\n\nThis, we believe, will lead to better, more coherent policies and plans, where governments take a systems perspective, where interactions between the different SDGs are at the very least informing different sectoral decisions, and where one might even hope for a joined-up perspective on government priorities shared by all departments.\n\nCOVID responses illustrate the classic problem of policy coherence, which can be detected in how widely different national strategies and responses have been. The differences in response will no doubt be the subject of many future political science dissertations. Many countries opted for very harsh measures of lock down, curfew and school closures to contain the infection spread, some in combination with individual tracking and tracing via mobile phone apps. Others opted for more voluntary restrictions, offering ârecommendationsâ and only late in the day started to close down schools. Arguments have been made for a comprehensive perspective on pandemic response so that the cure is not worse than the disease â which is perhaps difficult to imagine as we approach [4 million deaths](https://covid19.who.int/)\n with COVID-19. Do you take a narrow âsectoralâ view on disease control, or do you take a broader public health perspective, including how people are affected by restrictions in their lives, losing jobs, or being locked in their apartments? Or do you take an even wider perspective, factoring in also how the economy or the environment are affected?\n\nEach approach comes with pros and cons, that are so profound and alarming, that it feels almost unethical to write about them â especially as we are still to fully uncover the long-term effects of the pandemic worldwide. Should we be weighing up avoided COVID deaths against cases of depression, isolation and maybe suicides due to lock down? Or against a âlost generationâ of children that has been denied effective education for over a year? And what about against the many millions of people who now must find a way to dig themselves out of a new state of poverty?\n\nWhat has determined or prompted the differential pandemic responses? Here, new political science research will be needed, testing different hypotheses. Explanations will have to be sought, for instance, in the institutional arrangements for public health and disease prevention; in the distribution of roles and mandates for crisis response and government action; in the roles of local, regional and national state actors and private firms in health care; but also, in a widespread political and societal culture of acceptance for strong state control and bans, versus respect for individual rights, freedoms, and integrity. Human rights and freedoms are often taken for granted in those parts of the world where we have them today, but history tells us that they have been hard earned and can be relatively easily lost.\n\nCOVID recovery is equally pertinent as a problem of policy coherence â for example building back as quickly as possible, versus building back greener and better? The latter will likely be causing delays, transition costs, and possibly even job losses in the short term, but teeing up the economy for a transformative change, in line with the ambitions of the 2030 Agenda, with better jobs and more equal economic outcomes. This is of crucial importance, as the human, social, financial, and economic consequences of this crisis across the world have effectively compromised our ability to achieve the SDGs.\n\nHaving worked on problems of coherence, policy effectiveness and sustainability for nearly three decades now, I believe in taking the broader view. I believe in the need to make some hard choices based on comprehensive information of potential impacts across society. This is ultimately what the center of government must do, and will do, anyway. Hopefully intently and not by consequence of its decisions.\n\nHowever, the institutional barriers against doing this in a systematic way are massive. Coherence comes with real transaction costs and immediate trade-offs: competing resource demands, a longer execution (getting people together and thinking jointly takes time); and leading to potentially unclear accountability relations. Coherence also goes against our nature as herd creatures, our deeply rooted specialization logic in modern work life, as well as rules -formal and informal-, and standard operating procedure which have been in place for decades.\n\nHaving said that, coherence is not by any means an impossible objective and we should not give up on coherent policy making as âthe holy grailâ for governments. But given the barriers, we do need to perhaps have realistic expectations about how far it can go at the level of central government, and, crucially, think harder about what integration and coherence can be achieved âdown-streamâ i.e., where the rubber hits the road in terms of implementation, plans, actions, and investment. The current pandemic is again a case in point, as it has so forcefully brought local actors â such as local and regional governments, civil servants, health staff, NGOs, and communities in general â to the forefront in that these actors have had to respond rapidly to fast-changing realities and emergencies, all while ensuring the safety and protection of people, especially the most vulnerable ones.\n\nThe question then is, what does coherence mean for actors beyond national governments, and how can they adopt coherence as a principle and approach in their strategies and actions? This will be, in my view, the make-or-break issue for SDG implementation. For this reason, I leave here the following invitations and ideas for the different actor groups to join the debate around coherent policies, plans and practices in pursuing the 2030 Agenda.\n\nFor fellow researchers\n\nWe, as research communities, will have to study and understand better the ramifications on sustainable development overall of different pandemic responses around the world. We must not only help understand the effects of what has happened but also do our homework in designing and proposing integrated and coherent recovery paths â and be vocal about them. We must make sure those who make the decisions in your context, hear the options we come up with. Â For example, we should invest to generate the evidence that is needed for carrying out comprehensive impact assessments across the 17 SDGs in different countries.\n\nFor associations and networks\n\nYou have a key role to play as governments increasingly have to ensure that different voices are being heard and work with all relevant actors to identify challenges, set priorities, align actions, and mobilize resources. As associations, you have the opportunity to represent the interests and priorities of your constituencies (e.g., women and youth). But you also have a role to support and embody coherence, which implies going beyond thinking about what other sectors and decisions have as impacts on you, but also to consider how your priorities and request affect other groups and interests. Does your agenda generate synergies with other development objectives, and how can they be leveraged further? Are there any trade-offs, and how can they be minimized? This -inward and outward- view can be an effective input to policy making and help governments make more coherent decisions.\n\nFor the business and financial sector\n\nAlthough traditional public financing approaches, such as ODA and domestic resource mobilization remain essential, a vast amount of additional financing is needed to deliver the 2030 Agenda. Importantly, this makes the 2030 Agenda also a global investment opportunity. The world will be halfway through the 2030 Agenda timeline next year, and with the pandemic driving vulnerable groups into poverty, political pressure will increase to achieve the goals. Businesses and investors: you can help accelerate SDGs implementation, by coupling your leverage capacity with systemic and cross-cutting 2030 Agenda alignment in business practices, planning and investments. For example, you can use [SDG synergies thinking](https://www.sdgsynergies.org/)\n to develop strategic priorities; to test strategies and investments, not just to check against the SDGs but also to analyze and plan for the systemic effects; as well as to monitor the systemic impact of your activities.\n\nFor regional and local governments\n\nThe local level gives a more concrete and place-based understanding of what the SDGs mean in practice, and how they interact, which makes the whole 2030 Agenda and the question of coherence come to life. And it is at this level that the stateâs service delivery on 2030 Agenda priorities like housing, education, health care and environmental protection is actually meeting the citizens. Raising awareness and putting such systems understanding into practice does not require setting up a new organization. Local and regional leaders can play a key role by agreeing on priorities considering synergies and trade-offs between sectors in your area of jurisdiction, and between cross-cutting issues in multiple sectors. Many [methods and tools](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720319185?via%3Dihub)\n are increasingly becoming available to assist you in this task. Likewise, in terms of creating opportunities, look for spaces in national decision-making but also international debates. Make yourselves noticed in gatherings where governments, development organizations and foundations come together in search for promising ideas, which can direct more resources to the local level. For example, the [Local and Regional Governments Forum](https://sdgs.un.org/events/local-and-regional-governments-forum-32572)\n, a Special Event of the UN High Level Political Forum (HLPF) which illustrates the importance of localizing action towards the achievement of the SDGs and how partnerships are crucial in this regard.Â Another example is the [SDG Investment Fair](https://www.un.org/development/desa/financing/what-we-do/other/SDG-investment-fair/sdg-investment-fair-home)\n, which supports direct informal interaction among representatives of governments of developing countries, the private sector, and financial intermediaries with a view of accelerating the mobilization of investment for the SDGs.\n\nAs we slowly move towards a post-COVID world, policy coherence will be essential to supportingÂ a transition towards sustainable development. A future of more coherent policy making, where social and economic objectivesÂ and long-term sustainability and resilienceÂ goals are balanced, is not only up to national governments, but a multistakeholder game. We all have a role to play.\n\n\\* [_MÃ¥ns Nilsson_](https://www.sei.org/people/mans-nilsson/)\n _is the_Â [_Executive Director_](https://www.sei.org/)\nÂ _of SEI.

Coherence comes with real transaction costs and immediate trade-offs: competing resource demands, a longer execution (getting people together and thinking jointly takes time); and leading to potentially unclear accountability relations. Coherence also goes against our nature as herd creatures, our deeply rooted specialization logic in modern work life, as well as rules -formal and informal-, and standard operating procedure which have been in place for decades.\n\nHaving said that, coherence is not by any means an impossible objective and we should not give up on coherent policy making as âthe holy grailâ for governments. But given the barriers, we do need to perhaps have realistic expectations about how far it can go at the level of central government, and, crucially, think harder about what integration and coherence can be achieved âdown-streamâ i.e., where the rubber hits the road in terms of implementation, plans, actions, and investment. The current pandemic is again a case in point, as it has so forcefully brought local actors â such as local and regional governments, civil servants, health staff, NGOs, and communities in general â to the forefront in that these actors have had to respond rapidly to fast-changing realities and emergencies, all while ensuring the safety and protection of people, especially the most vulnerable ones.\n\nThe question then is, what does coherence mean for actors beyond national governments, and how can they adopt coherence as a principle and approach in their strategies and actions? This will be, in my view, the make-or-break issue for SDG implementation. For this reason, I leave here the following invitations and ideas for the different actor groups to join the debate around coherent policies, plans and practices in pursuing the 2030 Agenda.\n\nFor fellow researchers\n\nWe, as research communities, will have to study and understand better the ramifications on sustainable development overall of different pandemic responses around the world. We must not only help understand the effects of what has happened but also do our homework in designing and proposing integrated and coherent recovery paths â and be vocal about them. We must make sure those who make the decisions in your context, hear the options we come up with. Â For example, we should invest to generate the evidence that is needed for carrying out comprehensive impact assessments across the 17 SDGs in different countries.\n\nFor associations and networks\n\nYou have a key role to play as governments increasingly have to ensure that different voices are being heard and work with all relevant actors to identify challenges, set priorities, align actions, and mobilize resources. As associations, you have the opportunity to represent the interests and priorities of your constituencies (e.g., women and youth). But you also have a role to support and embody coherence, which implies going beyond thinking about what other sectors and decisions have as impacts on you, but also to consider how your priorities and request affect other groups and interests. Does your agenda generate synergies with other development objectives, and how can they be leveraged further? Are there any trade-offs, and how can they be minimized? This -inward and outward- view can be an effective input to policy making and help governments make more coherent decisions.\n\nFor the business and financial sector\n\nAlthough traditional public financing approaches, such as ODA and domestic resource mobilization remain essential, a vast amount of additional financing is needed to deliver the 2030 Agenda. Importantly, this makes the 2030 Agenda also a global investment opportunity. The world will be halfway through the 2030 Agenda timeline next year, and with the pandemic driving vulnerable groups into poverty, political pressure will increase to achieve the goals. Businesses and investors: you can help accelerate SDGs implementation, by coupling your leverage capacity with systemic and cross-cutting 2030 Agenda alignment in business practices, planning and investments. For example, you can use [SDG synergies thinking](https://www.sdgsynergies.org/)\n to develop strategic priorities; to test strategies and investments, not just to check against the SDGs but also to analyze and plan for the systemic effects; as well as to monitor the systemic impact of your activities.\n\nFor regional and local governments\n\nThe local level gives a more concrete and place-based understanding of what the SDGs mean in practice, and how they interact, which makes the whole 2030 Agenda and the question of coherence come to life. And it is at this level that the stateâs service delivery on 2030 Agenda priorities like housing, education, health care and environmental protection is actually meeting the citizens. Raising awareness and putting such systems understanding into practice does not require setting up a new organization. Local and regional leaders can play a key role by agreeing on priorities considering synergies and trade-offs between sectors in your area of jurisdiction, and between cross-cutting issues in multiple sectors. Many [methods and tools](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720319185?via%3Dihub)\n are increasingly becoming available to assist you in this task. Likewise, in terms of creating opportunities, look for spaces in national decision-making but also international debates. Make yourselves noticed in gatherings where governments, development organizations and foundations come together in search for promising ideas, which can direct more resources to the local level. For example, the [Local and Regional Governments Forum](https://sdgs.un.org/events/local-and-regional-governments-forum-32572)\n, a Special Event of the UN High Level Political Forum (HLPF) which illustrates the importance of localizing action towards the achievement of the SDGs and how partnerships are crucial in this regard.Â Another example is the [SDG Investment Fair](https://www.un.org/development/desa/financing/what-we-do/other/SDG-investment-fair/sdg-investment-fair-home)\n, which supports direct informal interaction among representatives of governments of developing countries, the private sector, and financial intermediaries with a view of accelerating the mobilization of investment for the SDGs.\n\nAs we slowly move towards a post-COVID world, policy coherence will be essential to supportingÂ a transition towards sustainable development. A future of more coherent policy making, where social and economic objectivesÂ and long-term sustainability and resilienceÂ goals are balanced, is not only up to national governments, but a multistakeholder game. We all have a role to play.\n\n\\* [_MÃ¥ns Nilsson_](https://www.sei.org/people/mans-nilsson/)\n _is the_Â [_Executive Director_](https://www.sei.org/)\nÂ _of SEI.

Finding appropriate mechanisms for the transfer of science and research into policies, programmes, and practice has become a major driver in finding approaches and solutions to achieving sustainable development. There has been a major push in the uptake of research and evidence-based technologies and funding also began mandating the use of activities that link research-generated evidence to policy and practice.\n\nA solution to bridge the gap between science, policies, programmes, and practice is to use knowledge brokers, who are neutral intermediaries that function as an interface between the creators and users of knowledge. They are the human force behind knowledge transfer, finding, assessing, interpreting evidence, facilitating interaction, developing accessible formats, and identifying opportunities for collaboration and exchange between the producers and users of knowledge and spur enablers for behaviour change.

In every episode, I bring you insightful conversations around the subject of sustainable development and learning, helping us all to achieve a sustainable future. Our guest for today is Mr. Patrick van Weerelt, the Head of Office of the United Nations System Staff College, Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development in Bonn. Welcome to the show, Patrick!\n\n**Patrick, can you introduce yourself and your work at the United Nations System Staff College Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development?**\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: Sure. First of all, thank you for inviting me. It's a great pleasure to be with you in this podcast or learncast. My name is Patrick Van Weerelt and I have the privilege to lead the work of the UNSSC Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development. The Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development is an integral part of the UN System Staff College. Our particular role as knowledge center located in Bonn, Germany is to respond to the comprehensive learning, training and knowledge needs of UN staff and partners, when it comes to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the Paris agreement on climate change. It's concretely means we design and deliver offerings ranging from face-to-face courses to online learning paths, and from leadership peer learning to learning academy. At the core of all of our efforts is a systems approach to get people to both think and act through the lens of sustainable development, largely, and more practically speaking, we demystify, synthesize essential information and serve as brokers between science and academia and practitioners, staff, civil servants, states, or other stakeholders in the non-governmental and our private sectors.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** So you mentioned about brokering and synthesizing, a lot of facts, information and knowledge out there. And I think a lot of the work of the United Nations System Staff College Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development is really around this concept of knowledge brokering. **Can you tell us a bit more about knowledge brokering and unpack this for our listeners?** **What is knowledge brokering and what is its role in the context of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development?**\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: Thank you for the question. It's a good one. And it's something that is truly at the forefront of many discussions in our house as well. And I believe I already hinted at it. When we're considering knowledge brokers, we're essentially thinking about people or institutions that connect different groups that have separate sets of knowledge but need to collaborate. In our case, we could be talking about scientists and policymakers, or about the knowledge-based shared among scientists, policymakers in the UN, and even about the UN internally.\n\nAfter all, we still see many discussions inside our own organization where different UN programs and funds are using similar words and concepts, but actually mean different things. And what is critical is that one is up to date, the latest trends, policies, and news. Now one has the ability to translate knowledge into something that everyone understands and has a great capacity for storytelling. As a knowledge broker, you really need to be a decision-making and be able to do due diligence to ensure you deliver meaningful content. And in a sense, we are advancing research to the next level by explaining it in understandable language and learning formats. One example in our case, for instance, is the work we have been able to do around the key elements of the Paris agreement on climate change and build a course around and link it to the five P's of sustainable development. One key element there to notice this as well is that knowledge brokering goes beyond the translation of knowledge alone, knowledge brokering means that we are actively involved in the debate, and that is important to stress. And I would say, in fact, that is what we believe sets us apart from many others. We not only have experience and expertise in instructional design and learning, but we also have genuine in our sustainable development and UN programming expertise, which allows us to engage as much as the program policy intersection, as it does at the science policy intersection and ability to bring all these elements together in understandable formats is truly, I believe, something that will help all of us further the need for transformative change.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** **Can you expand a bit more on the role of the Knowledge Center in this knowledge brokering?**Â **What groups and individuals that you conduct knowledge brokering for? You have already alluded to the example of the climate change course. Perhaps you can also provide other examples?**\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: That's a really broad question that you're asking me there, and the answer could be equally broad, of course, but looking at current practice, we are particularly active in knowledge brokering for civil servants, whether working with schools of public administration or ministries of health, but also with UN staff. And this one is on the intersection of what I highlighted earlier on the intersection of UN programming processes and transformative change for sustainable development. And as today, I have to say I'm particularly proud of our UNCT leadership program in which we have literally taken senior UN leaders into brown coal mine in Germany, and let them interact with government officials, civil society, and the mining company to reflect on possible sustainable solutions for the future. It brings together knowledge, applications and reality in a format that is truly inspiring. And I believe our participants have really been able to feel and touch the need for that transformative change that we're all talking about. And I've actually been truly inspired to take that forward in their own settings as well. I would also say in that regard, it's one thing to highlight that on this Learncast, but for the listeners who would like to learn more about this specific example, I would like to invite them to contact us as we have also designed to very nice VR learning product around it. And I'm sure it can serve as a very interesting learning tool for many people.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Thank you so much for that, Patrick. I think a lot of our listeners would be so interested in that immersive learning experience that you mentioned, and really having this experience of going to a mine and being there present, seeing real faces and people who are really affected by some of the changes that are happening in their community. You have been working in the area of sustainable development for more than 20 years. And in your years of experience, **w**hat were the challenges that you saw in the exchange of knowledge? What I mean by that is **why do you think knowledge and learning is important in achieving sustainable development?** And **how were you able to overcome those** **challenges, if you can share some examples.**\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: Sure. I think what would be helpful probably is to go back even to the establishment of the Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development. Because we really used one central question to build the center around it and the question was, do people know what they need to know? And if so, do they demonstrate the corresponding behavior as a result? It seems a very obvious question and it certainly is. And the answer to it wasn't really hard to establish either, but it became a great starting point for discovery. And what we noted were a number of recurring key issues when it came to sustainable development learning. Let me try to capture them in five points.\n\nFirst, I think that will come as absolutely no surprise to anyone, we noted and still known today that the narrative of sustainable development isn't consistent when talking to different stakeholders.\n\nSecond, even if there is a lot of technical knowledge on a particular SDG, relatively little effort is put into, genuinely, bringing different streams together. On this side and in this regard, one of the things that we did as a result is we produced the sustainable development Rubik's cube aligned with the five Pâs of the 2030 agenda to explain the interconnections between the SDGs and within the larger context of sustainable development as a whole. Another very nice learning tool to explain the complexities of sustainable development to many different audiences. We saw in that regard that the current whole of system offered that we always talk about really needs to be strengthened and be more cohesive and integrated. And that is still a long way to go.\n\nThird, knowledge might be available, but it doesn't mean that when people know something, they have the conviction in their hearts to actually act, how do we make people part of the discourse, discovery, and solution. How to develop common purpose after all, we all know that success will only happen when all stakeholders have an incentive to make it succeed. This element is critical to reflect upon and to build into your learning processes as well.\n\nAnd fourth, coming back to learning specifically, we had to acknowledge that learning is much more than courses alone. Learning is about the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behavior, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. And for this to happen, learning formats need to be updated all the time. And a much bigger use of artificial intelligence will be needed to accommodate this. If everyone is offered the same, it might give room to people to believe they already know the course. This in turn influences motivation. And that's why it's critical to step up on what we say so fancy, to step up on agile and adaptive micro-learning.\n\nFinally, and related to my third point, life rarely bakes like a cake and too often sustainable development and sustainable development learning is approached as if we're baking a cake. We have a goal or a recipe and ingredient. But for transformative change to happen, we need to be much more flexible and creative and acknowledge that such processes are both technical and political. Sustainable development is inevitably dependent on the making of choices through the political process. And I believe it was Duncan Green in his book on âHow change happensâ, I think that's the title who stressed that we really need to learn to dance with the system. And I strongly feel it's that part, that learning to dance with the system, the political economy of sustainable development is often left out or not sufficiently emphasized in sustainable development learning.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** I really liked the analogy that you used with baking and dancing. So I think that's a really good way to put together all of these concepts. And one thing that I take away from that is that sustainable development is not a technical exercise. It's not like I'm looking at the recipe, but it's more complex than just following and ticking boxes in that sense.\n\nPatrick, we have so many young people listening to this podcast who I'm sure are thinking of becoming researchers, policy makers, leaders, or maybe even knowledge brokers, what you have just mentioned, which is a potential career path for them? Something that they can also engage in and do in the future. **What message do you have for young people? On their role in the building sharing and using knowledge and what can they do about knowledge brokering in their own communities and groups**?\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: Thanks, Paulyn. That is really an interesting discussion. And I know that many young people are deeply involved in these processes and are thinking about them. Also, considering some of the things we have not yet been able to do ourselves and should do more of, let me return to my original training as a human rights lawyer. One of the elements as a human rights lawyer, when we're discussing education, is a human rights-based approach to education. We're talking about absolute requirements to have education available, accessible, adaptable, and of quality. I'll leave the quality element outside for now, as that is a given that should be focused on. But when you begin to focus and reflect on learning, especially learning on sustainable development, you're essentially discussing a public good. If it's a public good, it is incredibly important to ensure that we make our formats and learning available, accessible, and adaptable. I would strongly invite everyone, young people and others, to start focusing on this, as it's often a challenge. This is also strongly linked to the whole process of open educational resources. What is needed is a significant boost, a massive ability to spread the word, and being comfortable with sharing. Through the sharing of experiences and learning, we can reach many more people who still need to be reached. So, when engaging in research and brokering, always keep in mind availability, accessibility, adaptability, and of course, the quality of what we're trying to present. And if possible, make it available to as many people as possible. This is easier said than done. It might sound extremely logical that this is how we should be doing it, but we have experienced that it's not always as straightforward for various reasons. However, we really need to receive a boost. We need to have a much more energetic community out there, one that also engages with people who are not like themselves. That is still a challenge that we're observing. If you are in one area, such as economics, start conversing with environmentalists. If you're an environmentalist, initiate conversations with economists, and so on. It's that sharing, building, and knowledge brokering that is required. I believe young people are much more open to these interactions and are more adept at making them happen. This is what we're seeing, of course, and I think it's strongly recommended from where I'm sitting.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** I read it like the three things that you mentioned about addressing it as a public good or treating it as a public good. And making it open and talking to other people. And this is so relevant also in the situation that we have now with the COVID crisis, with the COVID pandemic. And of course, with the vaccination, the research on vaccination and a lot of knowledge around the science behind it. I think this is also very applicable to this in this context making it public. Making sure that it is open and shared with everyone. Everyone has access to quality of knowledge that is good, and that can be adapted to the specific context of the different people. And talking to them different stakeholders, actors, friends, communities that are not usually the people that they talk to. I think this is really a powerful message for young people.\n\nPatrick, lastly, I know that UNSSC Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development has a lot of courses and materials on sustainable development, learning on the UN SDG:Learn. **Could you give our listeners some guidance on the materials and resources** **that UNSSC has on sustainable development?**\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: Sure. Obviously, we have numerous courses featured on UN SDG:Learn both fee-based as well as free of charge courses. But I would like to particularly point out our free-of-charge offerings. In my mind, these courses are certainly, of course, the basis of the reviews that we have had. They are certainly worth choosing, as they provide a seamless experience with continuously updated content, peer-to-peer learning included, and notwithstanding sometimes cohorts of more than 500 people, still facilitated processes. So, the way these courses are set up is quite special.\n\nAnd programs in this category also cover topics that are likely of interest to many listeners. One is the Paris Agreement on climate change as a development agenda, which I already referred to. It's a course developed in collaboration with the UN climate change secretariat. Another course is on Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development, which we developed with the OECD. The third course is on Anti-corruption in the context of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development developed together with the United Nations Development Programme. A very popular course that we also have is on Circular economy and a 2030 agenda together with developed in collaboration with UNEP. And then we have a fifth one on Unleashing the power of the private sector in implementing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which has a slightly different take on how we approach it.\n\nAnd towards the last quarter of 2021, we will be launching two more courses. One is on Social Protection, which we are designing and developing, I believe, in collaboration with the ILO. The last one is centered around communications for the 2030 agenda and the SDGs, which we are developing in partnership with the UN Office for Global Communications.\n\nAnd all these offerings are free of charge and interesting to engage in. Above that you can, of course also find SDG Primer course. We developed that at the request of partners and last but not least or better not, we, you, Paulyn, are doing quite an amazing job with this particular SDG Learncast. And that's another contribution to UN SDG:Learn, but also to sustainable development burning at large, because it comes back to the very fundamental element that we have that we are reiterating that time and again, that learning is much more than courses alone. So, in that sense, this is also a good way of getting back to the very start and to actually say to you, thank you for having these questions around sustainable development, around the Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development and what we're doing.\n\nAnd I can just say to all listeners that we do a lot of on demand services as well. So I would say don't be shy, reach out to us. We are always willing to explore how we can bring the message to as many different people as possible. And the more creative you are, the more creative we get. So again, just get in touch and look forward to hearing from all of you.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Thank you so much, Patrick. It's such a pleasure to have you at SDG Learncast.\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: You're very welcome!Â \n\n\\---\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** First we learned that when we talk about knowledge brokers, we refer to people or institutions who connect different groups that have separate sets of knowledge but need to work together. An important characteristic of a knowledge broker is the ability to translate knowledge into something that everyone understands and has a great capacity for storytelling. But we also learned that that knowledge brokering goes beyond the translation of knowledge alone but also involves being actively involved in the debates and discussions. Moreover, knowledge brokers have experience and expertise in designing learning experiences and substantive topics.\n\nIn the case of the Knowledge Centre for Sustainable Development, Patrick highlighted that its role as a Knowledge Broker in the context of the 2030 Agenda means that staff both have the expertise on sustainable development topics but also on designing and developing learning, which is more than courses. The ability to translate knowledge into understandable language and formats is crucial in bringing the science, programme, and policy expertise together and draw engagement from the different experts.\n\nLastly, we learned that even when knowledge is available and shared, it does not mean that behaviour change will follow and this where the role of the knowledge brokers becomes very important in the learning process among the different actors and stakeholders. They can ensure that learning is achieved through a process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behavior, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences which will require a constant updating of the approaches, formats, and ways of knowledge brokering.\n\nYou can find more of the SDG LearnCast on the UN SDG:Learn website. For now, Iâm Paulyn Duman.

Finding appropriate mechanisms for the transfer of science and research into policies, programmes, and practice has become a major driver in finding approaches and solutions to achieving sustainable development. There has been a major push in the uptake of research and evidence-based technologies and funding also began mandating the use of activities that link research-generated evidence to policy and practice.\n\nA solution to bridge the gap between science, policies, programmes, and practice is to use knowledge brokers, who are neutral intermediaries that function as an interface between the creators and users of knowledge. They are the human force behind knowledge transfer, finding, assessing, interpreting evidence, facilitating interaction, developing accessible formats, and identifying opportunities for collaboration and exchange between the producers and users of knowledge and spur enablers for behaviour change.

In every episode, I bring you insightful conversations around the subject of sustainable development and learning, helping us all to achieve a sustainable future. Our guest for today is Mr. Patrick van Weerelt, the Head of Office of the United Nations System Staff College, Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development in Bonn. Welcome to the show, Patrick!\n\n**Patrick, can you introduce yourself and your work at the United Nations System Staff College Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development?**\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: Sure. First of all, thank you for inviting me. It's a great pleasure to be with you in this podcast or learncast. My name is Patrick Van Weerelt and I have the privilege to lead the work of the UNSSC Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development. The Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development is an integral part of the UN System Staff College. Our particular role as knowledge center located in Bonn, Germany is to respond to the comprehensive learning, training and knowledge needs of UN staff and partners, when it comes to the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the Paris agreement on climate change. It's concretely means we design and deliver offerings ranging from face-to-face courses to online learning paths, and from leadership peer learning to learning academy. At the core of all of our efforts is a systems approach to get people to both think and act through the lens of sustainable development, largely, and more practically speaking, we demystify, synthesize essential information and serve as brokers between science and academia and practitioners, staff, civil servants, states, or other stakeholders in the non-governmental and our private sectors.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** So you mentioned about brokering and synthesizing, a lot of facts, information and knowledge out there. And I think a lot of the work of the United Nations System Staff College Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development is really around this concept of knowledge brokering. **Can you tell us a bit more about knowledge brokering and unpack this for our listeners?** **What is knowledge brokering and what is its role in the context of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development?**\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: Thank you for the question. It's a good one. And it's something that is truly at the forefront of many discussions in our house as well. And I believe I already hinted at it. When we're considering knowledge brokers, we're essentially thinking about people or institutions that connect different groups that have separate sets of knowledge but need to collaborate. In our case, we could be talking about scientists and policymakers, or about the knowledge-based shared among scientists, policymakers in the UN, and even about the UN internally.\n\nAfter all, we still see many discussions inside our own organization where different UN programs and funds are using similar words and concepts, but actually mean different things. And what is critical is that one is up to date, the latest trends, policies, and news. Now one has the ability to translate knowledge into something that everyone understands and has a great capacity for storytelling. As a knowledge broker, you really need to be a decision-making and be able to do due diligence to ensure you deliver meaningful content. And in a sense, we are advancing research to the next level by explaining it in understandable language and learning formats. One example in our case, for instance, is the work we have been able to do around the key elements of the Paris agreement on climate change and build a course around and link it to the five P's of sustainable development. One key element there to notice this as well is that knowledge brokering goes beyond the translation of knowledge alone, knowledge brokering means that we are actively involved in the debate, and that is important to stress. And I would say, in fact, that is what we believe sets us apart from many others. We not only have experience and expertise in instructional design and learning, but we also have genuine in our sustainable development and UN programming expertise, which allows us to engage as much as the program policy intersection, as it does at the science policy intersection and ability to bring all these elements together in understandable formats is truly, I believe, something that will help all of us further the need for transformative change.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** **Can you expand a bit more on the role of the Knowledge Center in this knowledge brokering?**Â **What groups and individuals that you conduct knowledge brokering for? You have already alluded to the example of the climate change course. Perhaps you can also provide other examples?**\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: That's a really broad question that you're asking me there, and the answer could be equally broad, of course, but looking at current practice, we are particularly active in knowledge brokering for civil servants, whether working with schools of public administration or ministries of health, but also with UN staff. And this one is on the intersection of what I highlighted earlier on the intersection of UN programming processes and transformative change for sustainable development. And as today, I have to say I'm particularly proud of our UNCT leadership program in which we have literally taken senior UN leaders into brown coal mine in Germany, and let them interact with government officials, civil society, and the mining company to reflect on possible sustainable solutions for the future. It brings together knowledge, applications and reality in a format that is truly inspiring. And I believe our participants have really been able to feel and touch the need for that transformative change that we're all talking about. And I've actually been truly inspired to take that forward in their own settings as well. I would also say in that regard, it's one thing to highlight that on this Learncast, but for the listeners who would like to learn more about this specific example, I would like to invite them to contact us as we have also designed to very nice VR learning product around it. And I'm sure it can serve as a very interesting learning tool for many people.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Thank you so much for that, Patrick. I think a lot of our listeners would be so interested in that immersive learning experience that you mentioned, and really having this experience of going to a mine and being there present, seeing real faces and people who are really affected by some of the changes that are happening in their community. You have been working in the area of sustainable development for more than 20 years. And in your years of experience, **w**hat were the challenges that you saw in the exchange of knowledge? What I mean by that is **why do you think knowledge and learning is important in achieving sustainable development?** And **how were you able to overcome those** **challenges, if you can share some examples.**\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: Sure. I think what would be helpful probably is to go back even to the establishment of the Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development. Because we really used one central question to build the center around it and the question was, do people know what they need to know? And if so, do they demonstrate the corresponding behavior as a result? It seems a very obvious question and it certainly is. And the answer to it wasn't really hard to establish either, but it became a great starting point for discovery. And what we noted were a number of recurring key issues when it came to sustainable development learning. Let me try to capture them in five points.\n\nFirst, I think that will come as absolutely no surprise to anyone, we noted and still known today that the narrative of sustainable development isn't consistent when talking to different stakeholders.\n\nSecond, even if there is a lot of technical knowledge on a particular SDG, relatively little effort is put into, genuinely, bringing different streams together. On this side and in this regard, one of the things that we did as a result is we produced the sustainable development Rubik's cube aligned with the five Pâs of the 2030 agenda to explain the interconnections between the SDGs and within the larger context of sustainable development as a whole. Another very nice learning tool to explain the complexities of sustainable development to many different audiences. We saw in that regard that the current whole of system offered that we always talk about really needs to be strengthened and be more cohesive and integrated. And that is still a long way to go.\n\nThird, knowledge might be available, but it doesn't mean that when people know something, they have the conviction in their hearts to actually act, how do we make people part of the discourse, discovery, and solution. How to develop common purpose after all, we all know that success will only happen when all stakeholders have an incentive to make it succeed. This element is critical to reflect upon and to build into your learning processes as well.\n\nAnd fourth, coming back to learning specifically, we had to acknowledge that learning is much more than courses alone. Learning is about the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behavior, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. And for this to happen, learning formats need to be updated all the time. And a much bigger use of artificial intelligence will be needed to accommodate this. If everyone is offered the same, it might give room to people to believe they already know the course. This in turn influences motivation. And that's why it's critical to step up on what we say so fancy, to step up on agile and adaptive micro-learning.\n\nFinally, and related to my third point, life rarely bakes like a cake and too often sustainable development and sustainable development learning is approached as if we're baking a cake. We have a goal or a recipe and ingredient. But for transformative change to happen, we need to be much more flexible and creative and acknowledge that such processes are both technical and political. Sustainable development is inevitably dependent on the making of choices through the political process. And I believe it was Duncan Green in his book on âHow change happensâ, I think that's the title who stressed that we really need to learn to dance with the system. And I strongly feel it's that part, that learning to dance with the system, the political economy of sustainable development is often left out or not sufficiently emphasized in sustainable development learning.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** I really liked the analogy that you used with baking and dancing. So I think that's a really good way to put together all of these concepts. And one thing that I take away from that is that sustainable development is not a technical exercise. It's not like I'm looking at the recipe, but it's more complex than just following and ticking boxes in that sense.\n\nPatrick, we have so many young people listening to this podcast who I'm sure are thinking of becoming researchers, policy makers, leaders, or maybe even knowledge brokers, what you have just mentioned, which is a potential career path for them? Something that they can also engage in and do in the future. **What message do you have for young people? On their role in the building sharing and using knowledge and what can they do about knowledge brokering in their own communities and groups**?\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: Thanks, Paulyn. That is really an interesting discussion. And I know that many young people are deeply involved in these processes and are thinking about them. Also, considering some of the things we have not yet been able to do ourselves and should do more of, let me return to my original training as a human rights lawyer. One of the elements as a human rights lawyer, when we're discussing education, is a human rights-based approach to education. We're talking about absolute requirements to have education available, accessible, adaptable, and of quality. I'll leave the quality element outside for now, as that is a given that should be focused on. But when you begin to focus and reflect on learning, especially learning on sustainable development, you're essentially discussing a public good. If it's a public good, it is incredibly important to ensure that we make our formats and learning available, accessible, and adaptable. I would strongly invite everyone, young people and others, to start focusing on this, as it's often a challenge. This is also strongly linked to the whole process of open educational resources. What is needed is a significant boost, a massive ability to spread the word, and being comfortable with sharing. Through the sharing of experiences and learning, we can reach many more people who still need to be reached. So, when engaging in research and brokering, always keep in mind availability, accessibility, adaptability, and of course, the quality of what we're trying to present. And if possible, make it available to as many people as possible. This is easier said than done. It might sound extremely logical that this is how we should be doing it, but we have experienced that it's not always as straightforward for various reasons. However, we really need to receive a boost. We need to have a much more energetic community out there, one that also engages with people who are not like themselves. That is still a challenge that we're observing. If you are in one area, such as economics, start conversing with environmentalists. If you're an environmentalist, initiate conversations with economists, and so on. It's that sharing, building, and knowledge brokering that is required. I believe young people are much more open to these interactions and are more adept at making them happen. This is what we're seeing, of course, and I think it's strongly recommended from where I'm sitting.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** I read it like the three things that you mentioned about addressing it as a public good or treating it as a public good. And making it open and talking to other people. And this is so relevant also in the situation that we have now with the COVID crisis, with the COVID pandemic. And of course, with the vaccination, the research on vaccination and a lot of knowledge around the science behind it. I think this is also very applicable to this in this context making it public. Making sure that it is open and shared with everyone. Everyone has access to quality of knowledge that is good, and that can be adapted to the specific context of the different people. And talking to them different stakeholders, actors, friends, communities that are not usually the people that they talk to. I think this is really a powerful message for young people.\n\nPatrick, lastly, I know that UNSSC Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development has a lot of courses and materials on sustainable development, learning on the UN SDG:Learn. **Could you give our listeners some guidance on the materials and resources** **that UNSSC has on sustainable development?**\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: Sure. Obviously, we have numerous courses featured on UN SDG:Learn both fee-based as well as free of charge courses. But I would like to particularly point out our free-of-charge offerings. In my mind, these courses are certainly, of course, the basis of the reviews that we have had. They are certainly worth choosing, as they provide a seamless experience with continuously updated content, peer-to-peer learning included, and notwithstanding sometimes cohorts of more than 500 people, still facilitated processes. So, the way these courses are set up is quite special.\n\nAnd programs in this category also cover topics that are likely of interest to many listeners. One is the Paris Agreement on climate change as a development agenda, which I already referred to. It's a course developed in collaboration with the UN climate change secretariat. Another course is on Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development, which we developed with the OECD. The third course is on Anti-corruption in the context of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development developed together with the United Nations Development Programme. A very popular course that we also have is on Circular economy and a 2030 agenda together with developed in collaboration with UNEP. And then we have a fifth one on Unleashing the power of the private sector in implementing the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, which has a slightly different take on how we approach it.\n\nAnd towards the last quarter of 2021, we will be launching two more courses. One is on Social Protection, which we are designing and developing, I believe, in collaboration with the ILO. The last one is centered around communications for the 2030 agenda and the SDGs, which we are developing in partnership with the UN Office for Global Communications.\n\nAnd all these offerings are free of charge and interesting to engage in. Above that you can, of course also find SDG Primer course. We developed that at the request of partners and last but not least or better not, we, you, Paulyn, are doing quite an amazing job with this particular SDG Learncast. And that's another contribution to UN SDG:Learn, but also to sustainable development burning at large, because it comes back to the very fundamental element that we have that we are reiterating that time and again, that learning is much more than courses alone. So, in that sense, this is also a good way of getting back to the very start and to actually say to you, thank you for having these questions around sustainable development, around the Knowledge Center for Sustainable Development and what we're doing.\n\nAnd I can just say to all listeners that we do a lot of on demand services as well. So I would say don't be shy, reach out to us. We are always willing to explore how we can bring the message to as many different people as possible. And the more creative you are, the more creative we get. So again, just get in touch and look forward to hearing from all of you.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Thank you so much, Patrick. It's such a pleasure to have you at SDG Learncast.\n\n**Patrick van** **Weerelt**: You're very welcome!Â \n\n\\---\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** First we learned that when we talk about knowledge brokers, we refer to people or institutions who connect different groups that have separate sets of knowledge but need to work together. An important characteristic of a knowledge broker is the ability to translate knowledge into something that everyone understands and has a great capacity for storytelling. But we also learned that that knowledge brokering goes beyond the translation of knowledge alone but also involves being actively involved in the debates and discussions. Moreover, knowledge brokers have experience and expertise in designing learning experiences and substantive topics.\n\nIn the case of the Knowledge Centre for Sustainable Development, Patrick highlighted that its role as a Knowledge Broker in the context of the 2030 Agenda means that staff both have the expertise on sustainable development topics but also on designing and developing learning, which is more than courses. The ability to translate knowledge into understandable language and formats is crucial in bringing the science, programme, and policy expertise together and draw engagement from the different experts.\n\nLastly, we learned that even when knowledge is available and shared, it does not mean that behaviour change will follow and this where the role of the knowledge brokers becomes very important in the learning process among the different actors and stakeholders. They can ensure that learning is achieved through a process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behavior, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences which will require a constant updating of the approaches, formats, and ways of knowledge brokering.\n\nYou can find more of the SDG LearnCast on the UN SDG:Learn website. For now, Iâm Paulyn Duman. Thanks for listening.\n\nÂ Â ---\n\n_Paulyn Duman is the Knowledge Management, Communications, and Reporting Officer at the UNSSC Knowledge Centre for Sustainable Development and is a coordinator for the Joint Secretariat of UNÂ SDG:Learn, together with UNITAR._Â Â \n\n_The opinions expressed in the SDGÂ LearncastÂ podcasts are solely those of the authors.

In every episode, I bring insightful conversations around the subject of sustainable development and learning, helping us all to achieve a sustainable future.\n\nIn this episode, we will look into the pressing threats faced by two of our planet's vital ecosystems: the Amazon Rainforest, often referred to as the \"lungs of the Earth\", and the Congo Basin, the ecological heart of Africa.\n\nRecent reports from The Guardian and Earth Insight paint a concerning picture, indicating not only a potential boom in areas allocated for oil and gas extraction in Africa but also pinpointing the relentless expansion of oil industries in the Amazon and Congo Basin, compromising their lush forests and diverse communities. The stakes are high with millions of lives, both human and wildlife, hanging in the balance. Join us as we untangle the complex web of fossil fuel expansion and conservation efforts, underscoring the immediate need for global decarbonization and the preservation of both ecological and cultural treasures.\n\nOur guest for this episode is Mr. Tyson Miller, the Executive Director of Earth Insight. He will share his thoughts on the need for 21st-century solutions that put people, nature and climate stability first. Tyson, welcome to the SDG Learncast!\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** **Why is the oil and gas expansion and the Congo Basin and the Amazon rainforest so critical right now?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** Unfortunately, this particular moment is critical because of a variety of geopolitical dynamics and concerns in play. Obviously, with the war in Ukraine, there's less access to fossil fuels. There are also a range of pressures specifically on the African continent. Exploration blocks represent about four times the size of current production blocks, so, there's a potential for a massive increase in oil and gas expansion. In terms of where those blocks are located, about 90% of all tropical forest and primary forests on the continent are in the Congo Basin.\n\nIn the Congo Basin region, there are about 70 million hectares, an area about twice the size of Germany, that currently host oil and gas production blocks. What's in play in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), is illustrative of the broader threats in other countries. Recently, there are more than 30 oil and gas blocks that have been put up for action.\n\nHydrocarbon ministers and others are really trying to find companies that will come in and engage in oil and gas expansion in the world's second-largest rainforest â a critical region. There are massive amounts of biodiversity, with over 150 distinct ethnic groups calling the Congo Basin home. Thirty-two million people, or 20% of the populated places in the Congo Basin countries, are now in oil and gas blocks. Now is a really pivotal time, where there can be alternative development pathways that Congo Basin countries choose, as opposed to what we've seen historically.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Three-quarters of the Congolese people are living on less than $2 a day. Despite the huge minerals and reserves and potential for renewables as you also mentioned. What's also important to highlight hereÂ is that they don't benefit from these operations. **How does the economic disparity in the Congo** **impact the region's approach to oil and gas development?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** There has been some really interesting mapping by a group called Resource Matters. They have conducted an analysis looking at what individuals and communities need in the region for true energy security, and it's not expanding oil and gas development in the DRC or other nations.\n\nMost of that, if not all of that, oil would be exported to export markets. So, in terms of what's needed locally to address sustainability, Sustainable Development Goals and regional needs, I think economic activity that is grounded in the principles of bioeconomy.Â \n\nThere areÂ ways in which communities can have expanded rights and expanded territories, as well as community-owned forests, to essentially ensure the integrity of the ecosystem and support local livelihoods that can enable the forest to stay intact and without big industry coming in, essentially exploiting the region for export markets.\n\nIf regional development is really the end goal, fossil fuel expansion isn't the path forward.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** **Tyson,** **what do you mean by bioeconomy?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** It's obviously different in different regions. There is a range of indigenous nationalities and federations that are developing life plans for how different types of economic activities can move forward without essentially fragmenting the forest or bringing large industrial activities.\n\nSo, in terms of solutions, there's a lot more needed for local organizations to define what types of economic activities they intend to pursue while maintaining the integrity and health of the ecosystem.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** There are also significant oil and gas expansion threats in the Amazon. **Can you explain** **what's at stake in more detail?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** I've been working on this issue for about five years or so. One thing that's really concerning, especially as someone who lives in the United States, is that the majority of the exports of oil out of the western Amazonâwhere most of the oil is exportedâare destined for the United States.\n\nAbout two-thirds of that oil goes to refineries in California. California has significant climate leadership goals and a reputation for environmental leadership. However, it is consuming a huge amount of oil from the Amazon. In fact, in California, where I'm originally from, about one in nine gallons on average pumped in-state comes from the Amazon.\n\nSimilar to the Congo Basin region, there's just a massive amount of undisturbed tropical forest or primary and priority forest, about 65 million hectares or an area twice the size of Poland. There's overlap with existing or planned oil and gas blocks. Just like in the Congo Basin region, there's a tremendous amount of indigenous and local communities and cultural diversity. There are over 500 distinct indigenous nationalities who call the Amazon Basin home.\n\nUnfortunately, about 25 million hectares of indigenous territories are now in either production or exploration blocks. This is really highly problematic. In fact, about 12 million people are living in approximately 10,000 villages or towns. That's 20% of populated places in Amazonia within oil and gas blocks.\n\nThe Amazon Basin as a whole, on average, is in the midst of a tipping point crisis. The ecosystem needs to have 75% to 80% intactness in order to generate its own rainfall and avoid feedback loops that would force the transition of the ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a tropical savanna.\n\nJust like in the Congo, the first cut is the deepest. So, when big industries like oil and gas mining and other major industries such as agribusiness bring in their infrastructure, you have a gateway to deforestation. It's really concerning that these two forest basins, which are the most bio-culturally diverse regions on the planet, are facing a degree of oil expansion.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** You've painted a stark picture for these two regions, the Congo basin and the Amazon rain forest. **Can you highlight other areas facing similar threats?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** Before I get into that, I guess what really has struck me is that the International Energy Agency has stated that to stay within the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, no further fossil fuel expansion must take place. But if you look at current forecasts for 2030, government expansion plans would lead to about 240% more coal, 57% more oil, and 71% more gas than would be consistent with a 1.5-degree threshold. That's affecting whether it's the Amazon or the Congo Basin or other regions. That is what we have to get out in front of collectivelyâfossil fuel expansion. It's just not compatible with progress on any of the SDGs and with our need for climate stability.\n\nYou would think these would be happening in the world's two largest rainforest basins and the threat of oil and gas expansion is illustrative of what we're facing globally. One area in particular is the Coral Triangle region. This is the most biodiverse marine ecosystem on the planet. We just did a cursory analysis of the oil and gas expansion threat in the Coral Triangle and we found that there are over 300 oil and gas blocks for production and exploration that overlap or that are in the Coral Triangle region, and that about half of all the corals within the Coral Triangle are in these oil and gas blocks. We did a deeper dive into the \"Banking on Climate Chaos\" report of the LNG or the fossil gas build-out in the Batangas Province in the Philippines and the Verde Island passage and found that there are all sorts of concerns and what that might mean for increased shipping intensity.\n\nThere was a recent spill there. You're going to have the likelihood of increased spills, but also that increase in shipping intensity and all the coastal development of these facilities on the coastlines has the potential to vastly impact the corals, the mangroves, the seagrasses that are all vital for these rich marine ecosystems.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** It sounds grim, but **where do you see hope? What are the 21st-century solutions that put people,** **nature and climate first? And can you elaborate on what the solutions might look like?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** Yeah, we all need to be focused on having clear eyes and a clear sense of what the threats are so we can avoid going down certain pathways or be prepared to counter those threats. But having momentum and creative, disruptive, bold solutions, momentum for these solutions out in the world is absolutely vital.\n\nI'll just mention that both the reports we produced \"Congo and the Crosshairs,\" and \"The Crisis Point,\" looked at oil and gas expansion threats to the Congo Basin region and the Amazon.\n\nWe profile a range of different solution frameworks that are out there as a core part of our analyses. I'm struck by a few solutions frameworks that are gaining momentum and steam in the world. One of those is the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. You can find more about that on the website, fossilfueltreaty.org. It's gaining steam, with island nations calling for other nations to commit to no fossil fuel expansion. That's a really bold, simple, clear solution.\n\nAt COP 15, there was the launch of the \"Moratorium on Industrial Activity and Primary Forest.\" which is vital. We need to focus on areas that have already been impacted, sustainable intensification, and in exchange for or in addition to drawing lines in the sand or around the areas that are intact.\n\nA lot of the oil and gas development goes back to the Western Amazon. In Ecuador specifically, but in a range of other nations, debtâpaying back loans and debtâis driving a lot of the industrial expansion. I think widespread debt forgiveness in exchange for keeping oil and gas in the ground and expanding protected areas could be a really pivotal solution.\n\nTo the extent that banks and financial institutions are really out in front and saying, \"Hey, we won't commit to any fossil fuel expansion.\" You've seen a number of those commitments, and they need to be strong and without loopholes.\n\nWhen I was working on the campaign in the Amazon, there were ING and BNP Paribas, a couple of banks that made those commitments globally, but also for the Amazon region. If we look at history, especially like in Brazil when they were able to cut their deforestation rates pre-Bolsonaro by 80%, a lot of that was because developed nations were providing resources in the form of payments for ecosystem services that enabled some of the new policies and codes. A whole next generation of what payments for ecosystem services look like. It is really critical.Â \n\nHonestly, carbon markets have been critiqued and criticized for good reason for quite a lot of time for not being as effective as they need to be. But I think that there's a lot of potential with respect to high-integrity carbon markets where you can leverage those dynamics and the interest and the desire of companies to offset their impacts and their emissions through carbon markets. Those can be done in the right way.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General Guterres' Acceleration Agenda needs to be unpacked and prioritized. Out of the range of the broad scope of what he and others are calling for, shifting subsidies is a massive, bold, and disruptive solution. Shifting subsidies from the fossil fuel sector to the renewable sector would enable a just energy transition. It would enable the tens of billions, if not trillions, that are going toward subsidizing the industry now to be leveraged for what's needed and what's next. Putting a price on carbon, an effective carbon tax, I think is a disincentive. It has been talked about, but really implementing that on a global scale is vital.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Tyson, **can we really achieve sustainable development without the oil and gas companies, without the oil and gas expansion?** **Can the world really move on without them? And if yes, how?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** It's a critical question for our collective and shared future. There needs to be a transition, on-ramps or off-ramps, I should say. The short answer to the question is, can the world move forward without fossil fuel companies, or in what way can we hit the goals we need to hit with or without their engagement?\n\nThe short answer is yes, the world can move forward without fossil fuel companies having the power, the grip on decision-makers, and the policies that these companies have had. What's really critical and what's needed is a collective commitment to the managed decline and phase down; and reorientation of subsidies that are currently going to the fossil fuel sector. With these principles, certainly we can. If we can go to the moon, then we can reorient our priorities and our focus and be collectively aligned towards a path for our shared future.\n\nFossil fuel companies need to get out of the way and not subvert policies and try to leverage opportunities for every last drop. Honestly, I think that's what's critical and necessary. If we can finance massive wars and the like to the tune of trillions of dollars, we can finance the restoration economy. We can find the solution pathways. It's not easy to say, \"Hey, let's transition all of these trillions in subsidies from a sector and an industry that's pushing us off a cliff.\" That won't be an easy endeavour, butÂ it's absolutely critical. If we approach it in a way where we're getting the solutions, the resourcing that they need and we're clear about ending the fossil fuel expansion and countries and leaders committing to no new oil and gas licenses, and banks and financial institutions committing to not financing expansion, it's completely doable. We have to make the commitment and then we have to not just talk about it. Our actions have to be really clear and true.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Tyson, thank you so much for being our guest for this SDG Learncast, and I hope to speak to you soon again.\n\n**Tyson Miller:** Thank you so much for the opportunity and for your good work out there. And yeah, looking forward to future conversations.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** And that was Tyson Miller of Earth Insight. What did we learn from this episode?\n\nFirst, there are serious threats to our vital ecosystems. The Amazon Rainforest and the Congo Basin, rich in biodiversity and cultural significance, are under grave threat primarily due to the aggressive expansion of the oil industry. An alarming projection suggests a potential quadrupling of areas in Africa targeted for oil and gas extraction, endangering the essence of the Congo Basin. Such expansions not only jeopardize the ecological sanctity of these regions but also pose socio-economic challenges for the 35 million inhabitants within.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need for decarbonization strategies. As nations grapple with escalating energy demands amid global geopolitical shifts, it becomes imperative to adopt robust decarbonization strategies. We explored the nexus between fossil fuel interests and global conservation commitments, underscoring the need for international dialogues on conservation.\n\nAnd lastly, Tyson highlighted potential solutions and reforms to counter these threats. Our guest shed light on potential solutions and reforms to counter these threats. Notably, the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty aims to halt fossil fuel expansion, while initiatives like the Moratorium on Industrial Activity in Primary Forests emphasize protecting primary forests. Financial reforms are also seen as a pivotal solution, with a push for banks to lead against fossil fuel expansion and for the redirection of subsidies towards restoration.\n\nYou can find more of the SDG Learncast on the UN SDG:Learn website.

Tyson, welcome to the SDG Learncast!\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** **Why is the oil and gas expansion and the Congo Basin and the Amazon rainforest so critical right now?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** Unfortunately, this particular moment is critical because of a variety of geopolitical dynamics and concerns in play. Obviously, with the war in Ukraine, there's less access to fossil fuels. There are also a range of pressures specifically on the African continent. Exploration blocks represent about four times the size of current production blocks, so, there's a potential for a massive increase in oil and gas expansion. In terms of where those blocks are located, about 90% of all tropical forest and primary forests on the continent are in the Congo Basin.\n\nIn the Congo Basin region, there are about 70 million hectares, an area about twice the size of Germany, that currently host oil and gas production blocks. What's in play in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), is illustrative of the broader threats in other countries. Recently, there are more than 30 oil and gas blocks that have been put up for action.\n\nHydrocarbon ministers and others are really trying to find companies that will come in and engage in oil and gas expansion in the world's second-largest rainforest â a critical region. There are massive amounts of biodiversity, with over 150 distinct ethnic groups calling the Congo Basin home. Thirty-two million people, or 20% of the populated places in the Congo Basin countries, are now in oil and gas blocks. Now is a really pivotal time, where there can be alternative development pathways that Congo Basin countries choose, as opposed to what we've seen historically.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Three-quarters of the Congolese people are living on less than $2 a day. Despite the huge minerals and reserves and potential for renewables as you also mentioned. What's also important to highlight hereÂ is that they don't benefit from these operations. **How does the economic disparity in the Congo** **impact the region's approach to oil and gas development?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** There has been some really interesting mapping by a group called Resource Matters. They have conducted an analysis looking at what individuals and communities need in the region for true energy security, and it's not expanding oil and gas development in the DRC or other nations.\n\nMost of that, if not all of that, oil would be exported to export markets. So, in terms of what's needed locally to address sustainability, Sustainable Development Goals and regional needs, I think economic activity that is grounded in the principles of bioeconomy.Â \n\nThere areÂ ways in which communities can have expanded rights and expanded territories, as well as community-owned forests, to essentially ensure the integrity of the ecosystem and support local livelihoods that can enable the forest to stay intact and without big industry coming in, essentially exploiting the region for export markets.\n\nIf regional development is really the end goal, fossil fuel expansion isn't the path forward.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** **Tyson,** **what do you mean by bioeconomy?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** It's obviously different in different regions. There is a range of indigenous nationalities and federations that are developing life plans for how different types of economic activities can move forward without essentially fragmenting the forest or bringing large industrial activities.\n\nSo, in terms of solutions, there's a lot more needed for local organizations to define what types of economic activities they intend to pursue while maintaining the integrity and health of the ecosystem.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** There are also significant oil and gas expansion threats in the Amazon. **Can you explain** **what's at stake in more detail?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** I've been working on this issue for about five years or so. One thing that's really concerning, especially as someone who lives in the United States, is that the majority of the exports of oil out of the western Amazonâwhere most of the oil is exportedâare destined for the United States.\n\nAbout two-thirds of that oil goes to refineries in California. California has significant climate leadership goals and a reputation for environmental leadership. However, it is consuming a huge amount of oil from the Amazon. In fact, in California, where I'm originally from, about one in nine gallons on average pumped in-state comes from the Amazon.\n\nSimilar to the Congo Basin region, there's just a massive amount of undisturbed tropical forest or primary and priority forest, about 65 million hectares or an area twice the size of Poland. There's overlap with existing or planned oil and gas blocks. Just like in the Congo Basin region, there's a tremendous amount of indigenous and local communities and cultural diversity. There are over 500 distinct indigenous nationalities who call the Amazon Basin home.\n\nUnfortunately, about 25 million hectares of indigenous territories are now in either production or exploration blocks. This is really highly problematic. In fact, about 12 million people are living in approximately 10,000 villages or towns. That's 20% of populated places in Amazonia within oil and gas blocks.\n\nThe Amazon Basin as a whole, on average, is in the midst of a tipping point crisis. The ecosystem needs to have 75% to 80% intactness in order to generate its own rainfall and avoid feedback loops that would force the transition of the ecosystem from a tropical rainforest to a tropical savanna.\n\nJust like in the Congo, the first cut is the deepest. So, when big industries like oil and gas mining and other major industries such as agribusiness bring in their infrastructure, you have a gateway to deforestation. It's really concerning that these two forest basins, which are the most bio-culturally diverse regions on the planet, are facing a degree of oil expansion.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** You've painted a stark picture for these two regions, the Congo basin and the Amazon rain forest. **Can you highlight other areas facing similar threats?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** Before I get into that, I guess what really has struck me is that the International Energy Agency has stated that to stay within the Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius, no further fossil fuel expansion must take place. But if you look at current forecasts for 2030, government expansion plans would lead to about 240% more coal, 57% more oil, and 71% more gas than would be consistent with a 1.5-degree threshold. That's affecting whether it's the Amazon or the Congo Basin or other regions. That is what we have to get out in front of collectivelyâfossil fuel expansion. It's just not compatible with progress on any of the SDGs and with our need for climate stability.\n\nYou would think these would be happening in the world's two largest rainforest basins and the threat of oil and gas expansion is illustrative of what we're facing globally. One area in particular is the Coral Triangle region. This is the most biodiverse marine ecosystem on the planet. We just did a cursory analysis of the oil and gas expansion threat in the Coral Triangle and we found that there are over 300 oil and gas blocks for production and exploration that overlap or that are in the Coral Triangle region, and that about half of all the corals within the Coral Triangle are in these oil and gas blocks. We did a deeper dive into the \"Banking on Climate Chaos\" report of the LNG or the fossil gas build-out in the Batangas Province in the Philippines and the Verde Island passage and found that there are all sorts of concerns and what that might mean for increased shipping intensity.\n\nThere was a recent spill there. You're going to have the likelihood of increased spills, but also that increase in shipping intensity and all the coastal development of these facilities on the coastlines has the potential to vastly impact the corals, the mangroves, the seagrasses that are all vital for these rich marine ecosystems.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** It sounds grim, but **where do you see hope? What are the 21st-century solutions that put people,** **nature and climate first? And can you elaborate on what the solutions might look like?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** Yeah, we all need to be focused on having clear eyes and a clear sense of what the threats are so we can avoid going down certain pathways or be prepared to counter those threats. But having momentum and creative, disruptive, bold solutions, momentum for these solutions out in the world is absolutely vital.\n\nI'll just mention that both the reports we produced \"Congo and the Crosshairs,\" and \"The Crisis Point,\" looked at oil and gas expansion threats to the Congo Basin region and the Amazon.\n\nWe profile a range of different solution frameworks that are out there as a core part of our analyses. I'm struck by a few solutions frameworks that are gaining momentum and steam in the world. One of those is the fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. You can find more about that on the website, fossilfueltreaty.org. It's gaining steam, with island nations calling for other nations to commit to no fossil fuel expansion. That's a really bold, simple, clear solution.\n\nAt COP 15, there was the launch of the \"Moratorium on Industrial Activity and Primary Forest.\" which is vital. We need to focus on areas that have already been impacted, sustainable intensification, and in exchange for or in addition to drawing lines in the sand or around the areas that are intact.\n\nA lot of the oil and gas development goes back to the Western Amazon. In Ecuador specifically, but in a range of other nations, debtâpaying back loans and debtâis driving a lot of the industrial expansion. I think widespread debt forgiveness in exchange for keeping oil and gas in the ground and expanding protected areas could be a really pivotal solution.\n\nTo the extent that banks and financial institutions are really out in front and saying, \"Hey, we won't commit to any fossil fuel expansion.\" You've seen a number of those commitments, and they need to be strong and without loopholes.\n\nWhen I was working on the campaign in the Amazon, there were ING and BNP Paribas, a couple of banks that made those commitments globally, but also for the Amazon region. If we look at history, especially like in Brazil when they were able to cut their deforestation rates pre-Bolsonaro by 80%, a lot of that was because developed nations were providing resources in the form of payments for ecosystem services that enabled some of the new policies and codes. A whole next generation of what payments for ecosystem services look like. It is really critical.Â \n\nHonestly, carbon markets have been critiqued and criticized for good reason for quite a lot of time for not being as effective as they need to be. But I think that there's a lot of potential with respect to high-integrity carbon markets where you can leverage those dynamics and the interest and the desire of companies to offset their impacts and their emissions through carbon markets. Those can be done in the right way.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General Guterres' Acceleration Agenda needs to be unpacked and prioritized. Out of the range of the broad scope of what he and others are calling for, shifting subsidies is a massive, bold, and disruptive solution. Shifting subsidies from the fossil fuel sector to the renewable sector would enable a just energy transition. It would enable the tens of billions, if not trillions, that are going toward subsidizing the industry now to be leveraged for what's needed and what's next. Putting a price on carbon, an effective carbon tax, I think is a disincentive. It has been talked about, but really implementing that on a global scale is vital.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Tyson, **can we really achieve sustainable development without the oil and gas companies, without the oil and gas expansion?** **Can the world really move on without them? And if yes, how?**\n\n**Tyson Miller:** It's a critical question for our collective and shared future. There needs to be a transition, on-ramps or off-ramps, I should say. The short answer to the question is, can the world move forward without fossil fuel companies, or in what way can we hit the goals we need to hit with or without their engagement?\n\nThe short answer is yes, the world can move forward without fossil fuel companies having the power, the grip on decision-makers, and the policies that these companies have had. What's really critical and what's needed is a collective commitment to the managed decline and phase down; and reorientation of subsidies that are currently going to the fossil fuel sector. With these principles, certainly we can. If we can go to the moon, then we can reorient our priorities and our focus and be collectively aligned towards a path for our shared future.\n\nFossil fuel companies need to get out of the way and not subvert policies and try to leverage opportunities for every last drop. Honestly, I think that's what's critical and necessary. If we can finance massive wars and the like to the tune of trillions of dollars, we can finance the restoration economy. We can find the solution pathways. It's not easy to say, \"Hey, let's transition all of these trillions in subsidies from a sector and an industry that's pushing us off a cliff.\" That won't be an easy endeavour, butÂ it's absolutely critical. If we approach it in a way where we're getting the solutions, the resourcing that they need and we're clear about ending the fossil fuel expansion and countries and leaders committing to no new oil and gas licenses, and banks and financial institutions committing to not financing expansion, it's completely doable. We have to make the commitment and then we have to not just talk about it. Our actions have to be really clear and true.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Tyson, thank you so much for being our guest for this SDG Learncast, and I hope to speak to you soon again.\n\n**Tyson Miller:** Thank you so much for the opportunity and for your good work out there. And yeah, looking forward to future conversations.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** And that was Tyson Miller of Earth Insight. What did we learn from this episode?\n\nFirst, there are serious threats to our vital ecosystems. The Amazon Rainforest and the Congo Basin, rich in biodiversity and cultural significance, are under grave threat primarily due to the aggressive expansion of the oil industry. An alarming projection suggests a potential quadrupling of areas in Africa targeted for oil and gas extraction, endangering the essence of the Congo Basin. Such expansions not only jeopardize the ecological sanctity of these regions but also pose socio-economic challenges for the 35 million inhabitants within.\n\nSecond, there is an urgent need for decarbonization strategies. As nations grapple with escalating energy demands amid global geopolitical shifts, it becomes imperative to adopt robust decarbonization strategies. We explored the nexus between fossil fuel interests and global conservation commitments, underscoring the need for international dialogues on conservation.\n\nAnd lastly, Tyson highlighted potential solutions and reforms to counter these threats. Our guest shed light on potential solutions and reforms to counter these threats. Notably, the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty aims to halt fossil fuel expansion, while initiatives like the Moratorium on Industrial Activity in Primary Forests emphasize protecting primary forests. Financial reforms are also seen as a pivotal solution, with a push for banks to lead against fossil fuel expansion and for the redirection of subsidies towards restoration.\n\nYou can find more of the SDG Learncast on the UN SDG:Learn website. For now, Iâm Paulyn Duman. Thanks for listening.\n\n\\---\n\n_Tyson Miller is the Executive Director of Earth Insight.

The purpose of this course is to share the latest knowledge and approaches to measuring and managing plastic pollution from land-based sources, in particular cities, for the achievement of local, national and regional goals related to sustainable development.\n\n### ABSTRACT\n\nPlastic pollution is entering our oceans at an alarming rate, damaging our marine environments and endangering local livelihoods. The Asia-Pacific is an important centre of innovation for plastic waste management and a hotspot for pollution. Across the region, cities and city governments are at the frontier of global efforts to stop plastic waste entering the environment.\n\nThis course was developed for the Closing the Loop project by UN ESCAP in partnership with the Government of Japan. Closing the Loop aims to reduce the environmental impact of cities in ASEAN by addressing plastic waste pollution in the marine environment. In support of the ASEAN Framework of Action on Marine Debris and the G20 Osaka Blue Ocean Vision, the project will bring a more circular approach to plastic waste management and reduce the amount of waste entering the marine environment.\n\nThis course was developed to facilitate local government capacity building on the topic of marine plastic waste. Course development was led by UN ESCAP in collaboration with Ocean Conservancy, UN Environment Programme (UNEP), the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES), Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia (COBSEA), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the International Solid Waste Association (ISWA), Plymouth Marine Lab, Wageningen University & Research, Keio University and the University of Leeds.\n\nTo stay up to date with the Closing the Loop Project and view all our resources and publications please visit our website: [https://www.unescap.org/projects/closing-the-loop](https://www.unescap.org/projects/closing-the-loop)\n\nFor more information please download our eLearning Course Brochure:Â [**in English**](https://sdghelpdesk-elearning.unescap.org/content/courses/PLASTIC-POL/CTL-E-Learn-Brochure-Eng.pdf)\n,Â [**in Japanese**](https://sdghelpdesk-elearning.unescap.org/content/courses/PLASTIC-POL/CTL-E-Learn-Brochure-Jpn.pdf)\n\nTarget Audience\n---------------\n\n*   City governments;\n*   Other local and national-level policymakers;\n*   All other interested individuals and stakeholders.\n\nLearning Objectives\n-------------------\n\n**In this course participants will:**\n\n*   Learn about land-based plastic waste pollution issues in Asia and the Pacific region.\n*   Share contemporary scientific and practitioner knowledge and assessment methodologies to better understand the plastics pollution challenge.\n*   Explore state-of-the-art technologies and techniques being used to measure and monitor plastic waste in municipal and marine environments.\n*   Inspire action to tackle practical challenges in municipal solid waste management systems for terrestrial and marine environments.\n*   Equip decision makers and practitioners with practical tools, policies and approaches for tackling plastic waste.\n\nOffered by\n----------\n\n*   [United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ![United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/logos/_fit_200_200/escap-3.png)](https://www.unescap.org/)\n     \n\nRelated\n-------\n\n![Become a Player in the Energy Transition](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/19216/Schneider-Electric_300.jpg)\n\n### [Become a Player in the Energy Transition](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/become-a-player-in-the-energy-transition/)\n\nCourse\n\nFacilitated e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nITCInternational Trade Centre\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 7, SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12, SDG 13, SDG 17, SDG 17: Capacity-building\n\n![Circular Economy in Industry](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Circular-economy.jpg)\n\n### [Circular Economy in Industry](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/industrial-policies-for-a-circular-economy-a-training-programme-for-policymakers-from-developing-countries/)\n\nCourse\n\nSelf-paced e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nUNIDOUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 7, SDG 9, SDG 12, SDG 13\n\n![Introduction to Treatment of Tannery Effluents](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Tannery-Effluent-scaled.jpg)\n\n### [Introduction to Treatment of Tannery Effluents](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/introduction-to-treatment-of-tannery-effluents/)\n\nCourse\n\nSelf-paced e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nUNIDOUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 12\n\n![An Introduction to E-waste Policy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/226A1272-scaled-aspect-ratio-1920-1080-scaled.jpg)\n\n### [An Introduction to E-waste Policy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/an-introduction-to-e-waste-policy/)\n\nCourse\n\nSelf-paced e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nITUInternational Telecommunication Union\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 12, SDG 13\n\n![Air Quality Management](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Introduction-to-Air-Quality-Management-aspect-ratio-1920-1080.jpg)\n\n### [Air Quality Management](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/introduction-to-air-quality-management/)\n\nCourse\n\nSelf-paced e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nWBG -

These analytical tools are the ones most used by applied macroeconomistsâincluding those at the IMF. You will learn both how to technically implement these tools and to interpret their results.\n\nThe course will guide you through the different sectors of an economy. It will present tools to assess the relevant sector and its vulnerabilities. These applied tools will be simple to apply and they will bring out the critical information that an economist needs to make an assessment.\n\nBeyond the tools themselves, weâll also be showing how to refine and interpret their output. We will be doing more than just plugging numbers into a spreadsheet formula. We will want to use the results of these tools â filtered through our judgement â to develop a narrative of a countryâs economic situation.\n\nTo help you make this course more hands-on, you will be examining a case study country called âDiagnostica.â We will run through a series of sector-by-sector assessments. Along the way, we will be demonstrating how to apply the diagnostic by using different country examples. Then, you will be asked to perform that same exercise and interpret it for âDiagnostica.â Finally, weâll be integrating our sectoral assessments into a comprehensive analysis known as a ârisk assessment matrixâ or RAM. This will give us a sense of where the major risks and weaknesses lie in Diagnosticaâs macroeconomic picture.\n\nMacroeconomic Diagnostics is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Japan.\n\nTarget Audience\n---------------\n\nThis course is open to government officials and the general public.\n\nLearning Objectives\n-------------------\n\n*   How to analyze potential output and calculate output gaps, identify expenditure composition of growth, measure inflation, and assess sources of inflation\n*   How to assess the stance of monetary and fiscal policy and interpret financial sector soundness and risk indicators\n*   How to analyze public and external debt sustainability, analyze the external position, and evaluate possible exchange rate misalignment\n*   How to assess the mediumâterm prospects of the economy including the sustainability of public and external debt, and identify impediments to longâterm growth\n\nOffered

Then, you will be asked to perform that same exercise and interpret it for âDiagnostica.â Finally, weâll be integrating our sectoral assessments into a comprehensive analysis known as a ârisk assessment matrixâ or RAM. This will give us a sense of where the major risks and weaknesses lie in Diagnosticaâs macroeconomic picture.\n\nMacroeconomic Diagnostics is offered by the IMF with financial support from the Government of Japan.\n\nTarget Audience\n---------------\n\nThis course is open to government officials and the general public.\n\nLearning Objectives\n-------------------\n\n*   How to analyze potential output and calculate output gaps, identify expenditure composition of growth, measure inflation, and assess sources of inflation\n*   How to assess the stance of monetary and fiscal policy and interpret financial sector soundness and risk indicators\n*   How to analyze public and external debt sustainability, analyze the external position, and evaluate possible exchange rate misalignment\n*   How to assess the mediumâterm prospects of the economy including the sustainability of public and external debt, and identify impediments to longâterm growth\n\nOffered

This test helps you to do a (self-)assessment of your knowledge of sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs as the overarching framework guiding the UN work on the ground. All questions are based on [the Foundational Primer and the SDG Primer e-course](https://www.sdglearn.test/sdg-primer/)\n.\n\nThe assessment consists of multiple-choice questions. Each question is a multiple-choice question with four answer choices. Read each question and answer choices carefully and choose the ONE best answer.\n\nThere are 15 questions in this section.

website](https://www.unescap.org)\n\n![Asia pacific 3](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/asia-pacific-3.jpg)\n\nThe United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is the regional development arm of the United Nations for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nESCAP provides a forum for its member States to promote regional cooperation and collective action in pursuit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, assisting countries to achieve shared economic growth and social equity. In addition, ESCAP gives stronger participation to the smaller and often left out voices of the region, the least developed countries, the small island developing States and landlocked developing States.\n\nESCAPâs norm setting and policy work ultimately impacts peopleâs lives in a positive way by helping countries shape and implement a more balanced and inclusive development agenda for the region.\n\nThe ESCAP secretariat comprises the Office of the Executive Secretary, nine substantive Divisions, the Division of Administration, and the Strategy and Programme Management Division. The delivery of ESCAPâs programmes is supported by the subregional offices and the regional institutions.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region, a home of the two thirds of the worldâs population, including the majority of the global youth, is emerging as the global driver for achieving progress on the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs. Asia-Pacific has evolved into the worldâs production facility for goods, food and services. That has aided Governments of the Asia-Pacific countries to make steady and unaltering progress and achieve accelerated economic growth in the last three decades, which has allowed them to reduce extreme poverty (on less than $1.90 per day) for hundreds of millions of their most disadvantaged people. While economic growth and productivity increases have brought great rewards, they have by no means been evenly distributed and have largely contributed to the regional increase of GHG emissions and the decline of the regionâs limited environmental carrying capacity. The Asia-Pacific faces many unique challenges that both necessitate the achievement of the SDGs and hinder their progress. However, comprehensive understanding of the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs provide the tools to address the current performance challenges for many of the SDGs through genuine and inclusive engagement of all for stakeholders, tapping into the regionâs immense potential and diversity.\n\nHow would you want to learn today?\n----------------------------------\n\nCourses Microlearning Resources\n\n###

organizations and knowledge providers\n\nESCAP has established the SDG Help Desk in response to requests for capacity development support from member States. As its main function, the SDG Help Desk works as a gateway to resources and services, by linking users to other sectoral online platforms, focusing in areas related to the implementation of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda. The SDG Help Desk serves as the primary modality for coordinating ESCAPâs support to member States in specific priority areas such as integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, stakeholder engagement, and effective follow-up and review.\n\nFind learning that best fit your needs\n--------------------------------------\n\nText search   Search\n\n*   [2030

website](https://www.unescap.org)\n\n![Asia pacific 3](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/asia-pacific-3.jpg)\n\nThe United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) is the regional development arm of the United Nations for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nESCAP provides a forum for its member States to promote regional cooperation and collective action in pursuit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, assisting countries to achieve shared economic growth and social equity. In addition, ESCAP gives stronger participation to the smaller and often left out voices of the region, the least developed countries, the small island developing States and landlocked developing States.\n\nESCAPâs norm setting and policy work ultimately impacts peopleâs lives in a positive way by helping countries shape and implement a more balanced and inclusive development agenda for the region.\n\nThe ESCAP secretariat comprises the Office of the Executive Secretary, nine substantive Divisions, the Division of Administration, and the Strategy and Programme Management Division. The delivery of ESCAPâs programmes is supported by the subregional offices and the regional institutions.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region, a home of the two thirds of the worldâs population, including the majority of the global youth, is emerging as the global driver for achieving progress on the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs. Asia-Pacific has evolved into the worldâs production facility for goods, food and services. That has aided Governments of the Asia-Pacific countries to make steady and unaltering progress and achieve accelerated economic growth in the last three decades, which has allowed them to reduce extreme poverty (on less than $1.90 per day) for hundreds of millions of their most disadvantaged people. While economic growth and productivity increases have brought great rewards, they have by no means been evenly distributed and have largely contributed to the regional increase of GHG emissions and the decline of the regionâs limited environmental carrying capacity. The Asia-Pacific faces many unique challenges that both necessitate the achievement of the SDGs and hinder their progress. However, comprehensive understanding of the 2030 Agenda and the 17 SDGs provide the tools to address the current performance challenges for many of the SDGs through genuine and inclusive engagement of all for stakeholders, tapping into the regionâs immense potential and diversity.\n\nHow would you want to learn today?\n----------------------------------\n\nCourses Microlearning Resources\n\n###

organizations and knowledge providers\n\nESCAP has established the SDG Help Desk in response to requests for capacity development support from member States. As its main function, the SDG Help Desk works as a gateway to resources and services, by linking users to other sectoral online platforms, focusing in areas related to the implementation of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda. The SDG Help Desk serves as the primary modality for coordinating ESCAPâs support to member States in specific priority areas such as integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development, stakeholder engagement, and effective follow-up and review.\n\nFind learning that best fit your needs\n--------------------------------------\n\nText search   Search\n\n*   [2030

It was founded in 1948 with the purpose of contributing to the economic and social development of Latin America, coordinating actions directed towards this end, and reinforcing economic ties among countries and with other nations of the world.\n\nECLAC contributes to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through analytical and policy support on economic, social and environmental issues related to the 2030 Agenda and through customized capacity -building and technical advice activities by demand of its member States. Poverty eradication and the reduction of inequalities are central elements of the SDGs, and are key priorities for Latin America and the Caribbean and thus central to ECLACâs research agenda and activities.\n\nTraining is an integral part of the technical cooperation that ECLAC offers its member countries, along with its interdisciplinary expertise and intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder regional platforms to support the fulfillment of this ambitious agenda in the region.\n\nHow would you want to learn today?\n----------------------------------\n\nCourses\n\n### Courses\n\n![M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Master-of-Arts-in-Development-Studies-and-Diplomacy-online.jpg)\n\n#### [M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/master-of-arts-in-development-studies-and-diplomacy-2/)\n\nCourse\n\nMaster programme\n\n26 Aug 2024\n\nOffered by:\n\nUPEACEUniversity for Peace, UNITARUnited Nations Institute for Training and Research\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 4, SDG 8, SDG 10\n\n![Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Disaster-Assessment-Methodology.jpg)\n\n#### [Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/disaster-assessment-methodology/)\n\nCourse\n\nFacilitated e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nECLACUnited Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 11, SDG 17, SDG 17: Finance\n\n[Find more Courses](https://www.unsdglearn.org/learning/?type=82&region=353)\n\n### Courses\n\n![M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Master-of-Arts-in-Development-Studies-and-Diplomacy-online.jpg)\n\n#### [M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/master-of-arts-in-development-studies-and-diplomacy-2/)\n\nCourse\n\nMaster programme\n\n26 Aug 2024\n\nOffered by:\n\nUPEACEUniversity for Peace, UNITARUnited Nations Institute for Training and Research\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 4, SDG 8, SDG 10\n\n![Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Disaster-Assessment-Methodology.jpg)\n\n#### [Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/disaster-assessment-methodology/)\n\nCourse\n\nFacilitated e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nECLACUnited Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 11, SDG 17, SDG 17: Finance\n\n[Find more Courses](https://www.unsdglearn.org/learning/?type=82&region=353)\n\n### Courses\n\n![M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Master-of-Arts-in-Development-Studies-and-Diplomacy-online.jpg)\n\n#### [M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/master-of-arts-in-development-studies-and-diplomacy-2/)\n\nCourse\n\nMaster programme\n\n26 Aug 2024\n\nOffered by:\n\nUPEACEUniversity for Peace, UNITARUnited Nations Institute for Training and Research\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 4, SDG 8, SDG 10\n\n![Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Disaster-Assessment-Methodology.jpg)\n\n#### [Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/disaster-assessment-methodology/)\n\nCourse\n\nFacilitated e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nECLACUnited Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 11, SDG 17, SDG 17: Finance\n\n[Find more Courses](https://www.unsdglearn.org/learning/?type=82&region=353)\n\nPrevious content types Next content types\n\nRegional partner organizations\n------------------------------\n\n*   [National and subnational Governments from 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean](https://www.cepal.org/en/estados-miembros)\n    \n*   UN Agencies and Funds: As the convener of the regional coordination mechanism, ECLAC collaborates with the entire UN system in Latin America and the Caribbean\n*   Private Sector, Civil Society, Academia: ECLAC collaborates with numerous non-state actors on the 2030 agenda through its subsidiary bodies ([https://www.cepal.org/en/organos-subsidiarios](https://www.cepal.org/en/organos-subsidiarios)\n    ).

Caribbean (ECLAC) - the Spanish acronym is CEPAL- was established by Economic and Social Council resolution 106(VI) of 25 February 1948 and began to function that same year.\n\nThe Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) is one of five regional commissions of the United Nations headquartered in Santiago, Chile. It was founded in 1948 with the purpose of contributing to the economic and social development of Latin America, coordinating actions directed towards this end, and reinforcing economic ties among countries and with other nations of the world.\n\nECLAC contributes to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through analytical and policy support on economic, social and environmental issues related to the 2030 Agenda and through customized capacity -building and technical advice activities by demand of its member States. Poverty eradication and the reduction of inequalities are central elements of the SDGs, and are key priorities for Latin America and the Caribbean and thus central to ECLACâs research agenda and activities.\n\nTraining is an integral part of the technical cooperation that ECLAC offers its member countries, along with its interdisciplinary expertise and intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder regional platforms to support the fulfillment of this ambitious agenda in the region.\n\nHow would you want to learn today?\n----------------------------------\n\nCourses\n\n### Courses\n\n![M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Master-of-Arts-in-Development-Studies-and-Diplomacy-online.jpg)\n\n#### [M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/master-of-arts-in-development-studies-and-diplomacy-2/)\n\nCourse\n\nMaster programme\n\n26 Aug 2024\n\nOffered by:\n\nUPEACEUniversity for Peace, UNITARUnited Nations Institute for Training and Research\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 4, SDG 8, SDG 10\n\n![Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Disaster-Assessment-Methodology.jpg)\n\n#### [Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/disaster-assessment-methodology/)\n\nCourse\n\nFacilitated e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nECLACUnited Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 11, SDG 17, SDG 17: Finance\n\n[Find more Courses](https://www.unsdglearn.org/learning/?type=82&region=353)\n\n### Courses\n\n![M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Master-of-Arts-in-Development-Studies-and-Diplomacy-online.jpg)\n\n#### [M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/master-of-arts-in-development-studies-and-diplomacy-2/)\n\nCourse\n\nMaster programme\n\n26 Aug 2024\n\nOffered by:\n\nUPEACEUniversity for Peace, UNITARUnited Nations Institute for Training and Research\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 4, SDG 8, SDG 10\n\n![Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Disaster-Assessment-Methodology.jpg)\n\n#### [Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/disaster-assessment-methodology/)\n\nCourse\n\nFacilitated e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nECLACUnited Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 11, SDG 17, SDG 17: Finance\n\n[Find more Courses](https://www.unsdglearn.org/learning/?type=82&region=353)\n\n### Courses\n\n![M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Master-of-Arts-in-Development-Studies-and-Diplomacy-online.jpg)\n\n#### [M.A. Development Studies and Diplomacy](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/master-of-arts-in-development-studies-and-diplomacy-2/)\n\nCourse\n\nMaster programme\n\n26 Aug 2024\n\nOffered by:\n\nUPEACEUniversity for Peace, UNITARUnited Nations Institute for Training and Research\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 4, SDG 8, SDG 10\n\n![Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/Disaster-Assessment-Methodology.jpg)\n\n#### [Disaster Assessment Methodology](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/disaster-assessment-methodology/)\n\nCourse\n\nFacilitated e-learning\n\nOffered by:\n\nECLACUnited Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean\n\nSDG\n\nSDG: SDG 11, SDG 17, SDG 17: Finance\n\n[Find more Courses](https://www.unsdglearn.org/learning/?type=82&region=353)\n\nPrevious content types Next content types\n\nRegional partner organizations\n------------------------------\n\n*   [National and subnational Governments from 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean](https://www.cepal.org/en/estados-miembros)\n    \n*   UN Agencies and Funds: As the convener of the regional coordination mechanism, ECLAC collaborates with the entire UN system in Latin America and the Caribbean\n*   Private Sector, Civil Society, Academia: ECLAC collaborates with numerous non-state actors on the 2030 agenda through its subsidiary bodies ([https://www.cepal.org/en/organos-subsidiarios](https://www.cepal.org/en/organos-subsidiarios)\n    ).

and curated learning solutions on sustainable development topics to individuals and organizations.\n\nThrough the collaborative efforts of the United Nations, multilateral organizations, and sustainable development partners from universities, civil society, academia and the private sector, UN SDG:Learn provides a unique gateway that empowers individuals and organizations through an informed decision when selecting among a wealth of SDG-related learning products and services that are currently available.\n\nUN SDG:Learn: Main Components\n-----------------------------\n\nUN SDG:Learn consists of three main components: The Platform; The Partnership; The Programme.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/UN-SDG-Learn-wheel-1.jpg)\n\n![The Programme icon](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/about_icon_01_110.jpg)\n\n### The Platform\n\nThe web-based Platform is a gateway that matches learnersu2019 needs with learning solutions offered by UN SDG: Learn Partner organizations targeting diverse audiences from government officials, UN staff, private sector executives and employees, parliamentarians, NGO workers, young people, journalists and citizens at large. The Platform enables a smart navigation through the growing wealth of various learning solutions including courses, tutorials, podcasts, analytical and other tools, and the expertise on topics related to SDG achievement.\n\n![The Partnership icon](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/about_icon_02_110.jpg)\n\n### The Partnership\n\nThe Partnership ensures that the Platform becomes a key resource and the main gateway for SDG learning. UN SDG:Learn is powered by a community of practitioners that bring together the main providers of learning solutions on the SDGs from the UN, academia and universities and the private sector. The Partners network engages in regular exchange on learning methodologies, tools, curricula, and courses relevant for SDG learning.\n\n![The Platform icon](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/about_icon_03_110.jpg)\n\n### The Programme\n\nThe Programme will feature and offer joint learning initiatives that will be co-designed as part of the UN SDG: Learn Partnership to ensure integrated learning support to countries.\n\nUN SDG:Learn is ultimately about allowing the UN family to work in collaboration with key partners and reach out to millions of people whose professional and personal learning choices will make a difference if we are to achieve the SDGs.\n\nUN SDG:Learn Partners\n---------------------\n\n*   ![Leeds Beckett

community in developing and implementing the global SDG indicator framework to monitor and report on progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\n2030

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), an essential but often overlooked technical body plays a pivotal role: the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs). This group serves as the driving force behind the development and implementation of the global indicator framework used to monitor and report on progress towards the SDGs. In this article, we delve into the critical role of the IAEG-SDGs and the global SDG indicator framework in advancing the global agenda for sustainable development.\n\n**The important role of the IAEG-SDGs for the SDGs**\n\n![IAEG-SDGs members at its 6th meeting, November 2017 in Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/IAEG-SDGs_Manama_Nov-2017.jpg)\n\nPhoto: IAEG-SDGs members at its 6th meeting, November 2017 in Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain\n\nEstablished by the United Nations Statistical Commission in March 2015, [the IAEG-SDGs](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/)\n was mandated to develop and implement the global indicator framework for the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. **_The group plays a critical role in guiding global efforts towards achieving the SDGs by providing a global indicator framework for monitoring progress, promoting accountability, and facilitating evidence-based decision-making for sustainable development._**\n\nTo ensure national ownership, the group is composed of 28 representatives of national statistical offices. In addition, it includes observers from non-member countries, regional commissions, and international agencies who have offered significant technical advice and support throughout the process. Members of the IAEG-SDGs regularly consult with countries in their respective regions and sub-regions to ensure that all nations' perspectives are adequately represented. The Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs serves as the Secretariat of the group.\n\nThe group operates under the auspices of the United Nations Statistical Commission and convenes periodically to review and refine the global indicator framework. The group has conducted its work in an open, inclusive, and transparent manner, and invited experts from member states, regional and international agencies, civil society, academia, and the private sector to participate in the consultations and contribute their expertise and specialized views on indicators. The group's diverse composition ensures representation from a wide range of expertise and perspectives, fostering collaboration and consensus-building in indicator development.\n\n**The development and implementation of the global indicator framework**\n\nThe guiding principles of developing the indicator framework given by the Member States were to ensure that the framework of indicators addressed all 17 Goals and associated targets, including for means of implementation, and preserved the political balance, integration, and ambition of the agenda. Following the principles, the IAEG-SDGs worked very intensively and conducted countless technical consultations to develop [the global indicator framework for Sustainable Development Goals](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/indicators-list/)\n, which was agreed upon at the 48th session of the United Nations Statistical Commission and adopted by [the General Assembly on 6 July 2017](https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n17/207/63/pdf/n1720763.pdf?token=9m84xa6qeTyW5sM4qW&fe=true)\n.\n\nAccording to the GA Resolution, the indicator framework is refined annually and reviewed comprehensively by the Statistical Commission at its 51th session in March 2020 and its 56th session in 2025. The global indicator framework is complemented by indicators at the regional and national levels, which will be developed by Member States.\n\nIn 2020, the IAEG-SDGs proposed 36 major changes to the framework in the form of replacements, revisions, additions, and deletions as part of the 2020 Comprehensive Review. Currently, the global indicator framework comprises 231 unique indicators. However, as 13 indicators are duplicated under two or three different targets, the total count in the SDG framework stands at 248.\n\nSubstantial progress has been achieved in the methodological development of the SDG indicators. In 2016, over one-third of the SDG indicators lacked internationally established methodology or standards. After the 2020 Comprehensive Review, all indicators had a well-established and internationally agreed methodology in place. These methodological advancements ensure the comparability, accuracy, reliability, and usefulness of the measurements, thereby establishing a solid foundation for monitoring the SDGs' performance. Furthermore, the proportion of indicators that are conceptually clear and possess good country coverage has risen substantially from 36% in 2016 to 66% in 2022. This improvement signifies progress in ensuring comprehensive and reliable data coverage, which is essential for effective monitoring and evaluation of SDG progress.\n\n**Proportion of global SDG indicators, by availability of standards and national data, 2016-2022 (percentage)**\n\n![Proportion of global SDG indicators, by availability of standards and national data, 2016-2022 (percentage)](https://www.unsdglearn.org/blog/navigating-progress-towards-sustainable-development-the-crucial-role-of-the-iaeg-sdgs-and-the-global-indicator-framework/percentage)\n\nSource: The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2023\n\nThe IAEG-SDGs is currently conducting the 2025 Comprehensive Review, which represents a crucial, albeit final, opportunity to enhance the indicator framework to facilitate global monitoring of the 2030 agenda.\n\nThe global SDG indicator framework serves as a cornerstone for guiding and tracking progress towards the achievement of the SDGs, offering the following benefits:\n\n*   _Standardizing SDG monitoring:_ The global SDG indicator framework offers a standardized set of indicators that countries can use to monitor and report on progress towards the SDGs. This fosters the establishment of a common global language for measuring and comparing sustainable development outcomes. It also promotes data harmonization, comparability, and transparency across countries.\n*   _Enhancing data availability and quality_: The framework has stimulated efforts to improve data collection and availability, particularly in areas where data gaps exist. It helps improve the quality of data because the framework provides clear definitions and methodologies for collecting and reporting data on the SDGs. It has led to increased investments in data infrastructure, statistical capacity building, and the development of new data collection methods and technologies.\n*   _Facilitating evidence-based decision-making for achieving the SDGs_: The framework promotes evidence-based decision-making and enables policymakers to assess the impact of policies and interventions, track progress over time, and design targeted interventions and allocated resources based on data-driven insights. The framework enhances accountability and transparency by enabling governments, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to track and monitor progress towards the SDGs.\n*   _Increasing awareness and understanding of the SDGs:_ The framework serves as a catalyst for raising awareness of the SDGs by simplifying their comprehension and highlighting pathways to achieving them. By clarifying what the SDGs entail and how they can be realized, the framework enhances public understanding and engagement in sustainable development endeavors.\n*   _Forming the basis for national indicator frameworks:_ The global SDG indicator framework serves as a foundational framework upon which national indicator frameworks can be built. By aligning with global indicators, national frameworks ensure coherence and facilitate comprehensive monitoring and reporting on progress towards the SDGs at the national level.\n\n**Other important functions of the IAEG-SDGs**\n\nIn addition to developing and implementing the global indicator framework, the IAEG-SDGs also carries out the following important work:\n\n*   _Regularly review and improve methodologies for SDG Monitoring_: The IAEG-SDGs periodically reviews and improves the methodologies on data collection, measurement, and reporting for SDG indicators. These methodologies provide guidance on definitions, classifications, and measurements to ensure consistency and comparability of data across countries and regions.\n*   _Improve data flows and global data reporting for the SDGs:_ The IAEG-SDGs developed a set of [guidelines](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/49th-session/documents/BG-Item-3a-IAEG-SDGs-DataFlowsGuidelines-E.pdf)\n     and [best practices](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/50th-session/documents/BG-3a-Best-Practices-in-Data-Flows-and-Global-Data-Reporting-for-theSDGs-E.pdf)\n     on how data should flow and be reported globally in order to track progress on SDGs. The key principle is collaboration and communication between National Statistical Systems (NSSs) and international organizations.\n*   _Facilitate collaboration and partnership building:_ The IAEG-SDGs serves as a platform for collaboration and partnership among member states, international organizations, civil society, academia, and other stakeholders involved in the SDGs monitoring. Through regular meetings, consultations, and working groups, the group fosters dialogue, consensus-building, and knowledge exchange to address common challenges and leverage resources for collective action. The annual physical meeting of the IAEG-SDGs has fostered many collaborations and partnerships among different data partners. The IAEG-SDGs has developed a [Wiki website on Good Practices and Resources on Sustainable Development Goals Monitoring](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/sdgGoodPractices)\n     by compiling and sharing resources, experiences, and good practices on SDG monitoring from countries and regional commissions.\n*   _Address critical data challenges through different working streams, working groups, and task teams_: The IAEG-SDGs has established work streams, working groups, and task teams focusing on the following topics: [data disaggregation](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/disaggregation/)\n    , [Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX)](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/sdmx-working-group/)\n    , [geospatial information](https://ggim.un.org/UNGGIM-wg6/)\n    , interlinkages, and [sustainable tourism](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/task-team-sustainable-tourism/)\n    . These efforts have improved data disaggregation, provided standards used to report and disseminate the SDG indicators at the national and international levels, and developed a [SDG Geospatial Roadmap.](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/53rd-session/documents/BG-3a-SDGs-Geospatial-Roadmap-E.pdf)\n    \n\n**Challenges and opportunities**\n\nDespite its achievements, the IAEG-SDGs still faces several challenges, include issues related to data availability, quality, and coverage, as well as the need for improved methodologies and the collection of disaggregated data to uphold the \"leaving no one behind\" principle of the 2030 Agenda.\n\nThe global SDG Indicator Database underscores significant data gaps persisting in terms of geographic coverage, timeliness, and disaggregation levels. This hampers a comprehensive understanding of progress towards realizing the 2030 Agenda, discerning regional disparities, and identifying marginalized groups. For several cross-cutting goals such as climate action (Goal 13), gender equality (Goal 5), and peace, justice, and strong institutions (Goal 16), less than half of the 193 countries or areas have internationally comparable data since 2015.\n\nMoreover, disaggregated data for monitoring the progress of vulnerable population groups remain insufficient. For example, out of 10 SDG indicators that require disaggregation by disability status, data are available for only 2 of them.\n\nHowever, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation and collaboration, with the IAEG-SDGs serving as a platform for sharing best practices, addressing data gaps, and fostering partnerships between countries, international organizations, and other stakeholders.\n\n**Looking ahead:**\n\nThe IAEG-SDGs has made significant contributions to advancing the global agenda for sustainable development. Its efforts in developing the global indicator framework, standardizing methodologies, addressing data challenges, and fostering collaboration have been instrumental in guiding global progress towards the SDGs. I would like to encourage all data partners to continue to support and engage with the IAEG-SDGs to improve the monitoring and reporting to accelerate the progress towards the SDGs.\n\n  \n  \n\n------\n\n_\\*Yongyi Min is the Chief of the Sustainable Development Goal Monitoring Section at the UNDESA Statistics Division.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), an essential but often overlooked technical body plays a pivotal role: the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs). This group serves as the driving force behind the development and implementation of the global indicator framework used to monitor and report on progress towards the SDGs. In this article, we delve into the critical role of the IAEG-SDGs and the global SDG indicator framework in advancing the global agenda for sustainable development.\n\n**The important role of the IAEG-SDGs for the SDGs**\n\n![IAEG-SDGs members at its 6th meeting, November 2017 in Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/IAEG-SDGs_Manama_Nov-2017.jpg)\n\nPhoto: IAEG-SDGs members at its 6th meeting, November 2017 in Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain\n\nEstablished by the United Nations Statistical Commission in March 2015, [the IAEG-SDGs](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/)\n was mandated to develop and implement the global indicator framework for the follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. **_The group plays a critical role in guiding global efforts towards achieving the SDGs by providing a global indicator framework for monitoring progress, promoting accountability, and facilitating evidence-based decision-making for sustainable development._**\n\nTo ensure national ownership, the group is composed of 28 representatives of national statistical offices. In addition, it includes observers from non-member countries, regional commissions, and international agencies who have offered significant technical advice and support throughout the process. Members of the IAEG-SDGs regularly consult with countries in their respective regions and sub-regions to ensure that all nations' perspectives are adequately represented.

The IAEG-SDGs has developed a [Wiki website on Good Practices and Resources on Sustainable Development Goals Monitoring](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/sdgGoodPractices)\n     by compiling and sharing resources, experiences, and good practices on SDG monitoring from countries and regional commissions.\n*   _Address critical data challenges through different working streams, working groups, and task teams_: The IAEG-SDGs has established work streams, working groups, and task teams focusing on the following topics: [data disaggregation](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/disaggregation/)\n    , [Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange (SDMX)](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/sdmx-working-group/)\n    , [geospatial information](https://ggim.un.org/UNGGIM-wg6/)\n    , interlinkages, and [sustainable tourism](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/iaeg-sdgs/task-team-sustainable-tourism/)\n    . These efforts have improved data disaggregation, provided standards used to report and disseminate the SDG indicators at the national and international levels, and developed a [SDG Geospatial Roadmap.](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/statcom/53rd-session/documents/BG-3a-SDGs-Geospatial-Roadmap-E.pdf)\n    \n\n**Challenges and opportunities**\n\nDespite its achievements, the IAEG-SDGs still faces several challenges, include issues related to data availability, quality, and coverage, as well as the need for improved methodologies and the collection of disaggregated data to uphold the \"leaving no one behind\" principle of the 2030 Agenda.\n\nThe global SDG Indicator Database underscores significant data gaps persisting in terms of geographic coverage, timeliness, and disaggregation levels. This hampers a comprehensive understanding of progress towards realizing the 2030 Agenda, discerning regional disparities, and identifying marginalized groups. For several cross-cutting goals such as climate action (Goal 13), gender equality (Goal 5), and peace, justice, and strong institutions (Goal 16), less than half of the 193 countries or areas have internationally comparable data since 2015.\n\nMoreover, disaggregated data for monitoring the progress of vulnerable population groups remain insufficient. For example, out of 10 SDG indicators that require disaggregation by disability status, data are available for only 2 of them.\n\nHowever, these challenges also present opportunities for innovation and collaboration, with the IAEG-SDGs serving as a platform for sharing best practices, addressing data gaps, and fostering partnerships between countries, international organizations, and other stakeholders.\n\n**Looking ahead:**\n\nThe IAEG-SDGs has made significant contributions to advancing the global agenda for sustainable development. Its efforts in developing the global indicator framework, standardizing methodologies, addressing data challenges, and fostering collaboration have been instrumental in guiding global progress towards the SDGs. I would like to encourage all data partners to continue to support and engage with the IAEG-SDGs to improve the monitoring and reporting to accelerate the progress towards the SDGs.\n\n  \n  \n\n------\n\n_\\*Yongyi Min is the Chief of the Sustainable Development Goal Monitoring Section at the UNDESA Statistics Division.

Thanks to the SDGs, the appreciation for the work and statistics produced by the NSC has significantly changed among the users.â â Nazira, Kerimalieva._\n\nThis is a blog about Ms. Nazira Kerimalieva, the First Deputy Chairman of the National Statistical Committee (NSC) of the Kyrgyz Republic, who is a dedicated public servant and has worked many years in the area of sustainable development and environment statistics in Kyrgyzstan. Through her dedication and guidance of others, the National Statistical Committee has made significant strides in implementing Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring mechanisms.\n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic has applied a unique approach to monitoring SDG indicators, focusing on multi-stakeholder engagement, communication, and innovation, and setting a benchmark for many aspiring nations in the pursuit of achieving SDGs. Nazira has passionately shared with UN SDG:Learn valuable insights from their voyage.\n\n**The Kyrgyz Approach to SDG Monitoring**\n\nAs soon as the Kyrgyz Republic committed to its international obligations to implement the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the National Statistical Committee has been diligently engaged in establishing a comprehensive framework for tracking progress and reporting on SDG indicators. Embarking on a proactive mission, the NSC carried out a thorough assessment and adaptation of a big set of SDG indicators while concurrently formulating domestic indicators tailored to the country's unique context.\n\nFrom the outset, the Kyrgyz Republic adopted a multi-stakeholder approach to the SDG implementation. Moreover, as Nazira shares, the SDGs were interesting to everyone and they wanted to be part of the big global endevours. Engaging and getting feedback from a wide array of stakeholders - government bodies, civil society, business, academia and media - was foundational to ensuring that No One is Left Behind. This guaranteed that all voices were heard and integrated into the SDG monitoring framework. Together with the UN Statistics Division and other international organizations and partners within the National Statistical System (NSS), the NSC organized 40 different capacity-building workshops and trainings, roundtables, and seminars (links to the event available [here](https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io/en/news/)\n).\n\n![International conference on the implementation of an SDG national monitoring system, NSO KG](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/International-conference-on-the-implementation-of-a-SDG-national-monitoring-system-NSO-KG.jpg)\n\n_International conference on the implementation of an SDG national monitoring system organized by the National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2016._\n\nThese events were meticulously designed to serve a dual purpose. Not only did they aim to foster engagement with stakeholders, but they also functioned as valuable capacity-building exercises. The NSC made substantial efforts to enhance the overall data proficiency among its users and fellow data producers. This translated into a significant improvement in understanding and interpreting the data disseminated by NSC. In particular, the NSC played a pivotal role in elevating awareness regarding the importance of official statistics and the specific data requirements for effective SDG monitoring. Nazira, who has been instrumental in this endeavor, pointed out the specific role of the media in disseminating information among the general public. Understanding that media operates as a distinct entity, the NSC approached its engagement with them with a tailored strategy.\n\nRecognizing that occasional disparities in data capacity might lead to varied interpretations and narratives, special training sessions were organized for media professionals. These training sessions sought to bridge the gap, with participants being divided into groups based on their interests and preferences. Each group had a dedicated representative from the NSC to collaborate in developing content enriched with statistical data. The outcome of this engagement with the media was overwhelmingly positive, underlining the significance of building their statistical capabilities. Furthermore, the NSC maintains a regular line of communication with the media through press conferences, sharing insights into the overarching socio-economic trends and the progress made towards achieving the SDGs and other key national indicators. This has fostered a network of media representatives who remain closely connected with the NSC, contributing to a more informed and data-savvy society. The media has published numerous [news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Izjq75qiXYA)\n about the work of the NSC on the SDGs.\n\n![Screenshot from the YouTube Channel of the State Kyrgyz Media âAla-Too 24â.](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Screenshot-from-the-YouTube-Channel-of-the-State-Kyrgyz-Media-%E2%80%9CAla-Too-24%E2%80%9D.jpg)\n\n_Screenshot from the YouTube Channel of the State Kyrgyz Media âAla-Too 24â. News coverage about the first VNR of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2020._\n\nIn an earnest pursuit of transparency and collaboration, a dedicated working group has been established to cater to the needs of data users. This group comprises representatives from a wide spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, businesses, civil society, media, and the academic community. The primary aim of this initiative is to create a platform for regular exchanges and feedback, fostering an environment of constructive dialogue. This commendable effort is not a standalone activity but supplements the existing Council of Statistics, which already includes the representatives above, including the media. These dual structures contribute significantly to ensuring that data users, with their diverse perspectives and interests, are actively engaged in the decision-making processes and the development of data-related strategies.\n\nFurthermore, recognizing the importance of enhancing the overall national capacity of the statistical system and fostering innovative ideas for refining the SDG monitoring system, the NSC, alongside other stakeholders, engaged in international workshops, seminars, and training sessions. These international platforms offered a valuable opportunity not only to learn from the successful experiences of others but also to share their own insights that could prove beneficial to fellow participants. This global interaction is a powerful reminder of the significance of looking beyond one's own system and national boundaries, Nazira shares. The exchange of knowledge and experiences on the international stage plays a pivotal role in steering progress toward the SDGs and enhancing the effectiveness of data monitoring efforts. It underscores the NSC's commitment to embracing a global perspective in their pursuit of sustainable development.\n\nThe whole SDG journey, however, was not devoid of challenges. The expansive nature of the SDGs demanded an increase in capacity and a move towards innovative data collection methods. The National Statistical Committee has been working on the seamless integration of SDG indicators into the existing statistical reporting system. As emphasized by Nazira, this is no fleeting endeavor, nor is it the sole responsibility of one department. Instead, it is an ongoing collective effort that demands the active participation of all stakeholders to stay in sync with the ever-evolving landscape of new developments, best practices, data collection methods, and data sources. While one department may act as a coordinator, the success of this endeavor hinges on the involvement of all parties. Each individual contribution, no matter how small, contributes to a larger collective effort.\n\nIn the pursuit of effectively monitoring the SDGs, the NSC embraced the challenge of tracking new indicators. These indicators encompass a diverse range of data, from assessing access to electricity to the availability of mobile phones and bank cards. To ensure the quality and consistency of this data, the NSC worked closely with government agencies, providing them with standardized templates for the collection of metadata and metrics. A substantial portion of this data is generously shared by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Natural Resources, Ecology, and Technical Supervision.\n\nNevertheless, as NSC treads further into this intricate landscape, they acknowledge that the existing resources within the statistical system, including administrative data, have their limits. To address this, NSC initiated an exploration of innovative and non-traditional data sources. As part of a collaborative effort with the UN Statistics Division (UNSD) and Statistics Norway, training on use of geospatial data was conducted. This is particularly crucial as some indicators can only be effectively tracked through the use of geospatial data. In line with the SDG geospatial framework and overall goals of integration of geospatial and statistical training, both NSC and the National Geospatial Information Agency were trained, and data-sharing mechanisms were discussed. Kyrgyzstan was one of the first countries to make use of the SDG geospatial framework.\n\nAdditionally, NSC is delving into another promising avenue of data collection - citizen data. Collaborating with the UNSD as part of the Data, for Now, initiative, they are actively exploring the utilization of this valuable resource to enhance their understanding of the progress toward the SDGs. These initiatives reflect their commitment to leveraging the power of innovation and non-traditional data sources in the pursuit of a sustainable future.\n\nFor the Kyrgyz Republic, overall innovation is a driving force for progress. Through joint support from the UNSD and the Office of National Statistics of the UK, the country established a [comprehensive platform](https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io/en/)\n for data and metadata dissemination. This platform offers dynamic data visualization in the form of graphs, data, and metadata for each indicator, both global and national ones, as well as supporting modern machine-readable data formats - a leap forward in data accessibility. Nazira points out that the Kyrgyz Republic was one of the pilot countries to produce data in SDMX format.\n\n![Screenshot of the SDG Platform of the Kyrgyz Republic.](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Screenshot-of-the-SDG-Platform-of-the-Kyrgyz-Republic.jpg)\n\n_Screenshot of the SDG Platform of the Kyrgyz Republic._\n\nThe National Statistical Committee's publications, presented in engaging infographics, have further democratized access to information. These publications not only include data but also detailed methodology and trends of the indicators, making the data comprehensible and actionable for a broader audience. These publications are not standard publications of the NSC.\n\nThe NSC has prepared a [number of statistical publications](https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io/en/publications/)\n in such new formats. They are:\n\n*   âMonitoring SDG indicators in the Kyrgyz Republic, 2014-2018â,\n*   âStatistics of the Sustainable Development Goals in the Kyrgyz Republic, 2014-2020â,\n*   âSustainable Development Goals and Youth in the Kyrgyz Republic, 2012-2021â,\n*   âGender and Sustainable Development Goals, 2014-2021â.\n\nThe NSC was instrumental in the preparation of the first National Voluntary Review (VNR) on the SDG progress by supplying the data from the SDG platform and publications for the report. Kyrgyzstan, a trailblazer in its own right, presented its first VNR in 2020. This review showcased the nation's commitment, challenges, successes, and future directions. It covered 16 SDGs except for Goal 14 due to irrelevancy to the country. As the process and presentation of VNR coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, the report included also information on measures taken by the country to fight the pandemic.\n\nNazira emphasized the importance of continuous collaboration with different stakeholders and leveraging international best practices in the preparation of the national review as well. In the lead-up to the VNR preparation events, the voice of civil society emerged as a prominent and impassioned one. They expressed a strong desire to see their data included in the VNR report. However, it became evident that the data they presented was not comprehensive, lacked national coverage, or did not align with the established methodology for the SDGs. It was imperative to engage in a thoughtful dialogue to convey the nuances of these limitations. The NSC worked diligently to reach a consensus with civil society stakeholders. The decision centered on the utilization of official statistics for the core VNR report, while civil society data would be incorporated as illustrative cases.\n\nAs the Kyrgyz Republic gears up for its second VNR, the NSC, in partnership with the UNSD, is proactively embarking on an exploration of the potential incorporation of citizen data into the report. This forward-looking initiative reflects a commitment to expanding the scope and depth of data sources, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of the nation's progress toward the SDGs.\n\nOverall, the SDG monitoring propelled the Kyrgyz statistical system to evolve and communicate more effectively with more users and other data providers. According to Nazira, the impact of the SDGs extended far beyond just data collection. It brought about a perceptible shift in how the National Statistical Committee was perceived, significantly elevating its authority, influence, and trust levels among users, government bodies, and the general public. This shift in perception marked a turning point. People began to view the NSC through a different lens, recognizing the intrinsic value of the statistics it produced and the pivotal role it played in guiding the nation's development. The government itself embraced the data generated by the SDG platform, incorporating it into its reporting and decision-making processes on a regular basis.\n\nNazira emphasizes the paramount importance of producing \"fit-for-purpose\" data that genuinely serve the needs of users. This underscores the essential requirement for continuous capacity building to ensure that the data generated are not only accurate but also practical and valuable for those who rely on them. The NSC recognized the significance of effective communication and knowledge-sharing with various audiences. To this end, the government, users, and the wider public have benefited from a series of informative videos created by the NSC, which shed light on the SDGs and how to interpret and utilize them effectively. These videos come in various formats, including succinct clips suitable for social media platforms and longer, more in-depth presentations for those seeking a comprehensive understanding. Moreover, the inclusion of QR codes in the videos, as well as in NSC's brochures and publications, has proven useful in enhancing engagement and interest among users and the public. These multimedia resources have not only made data more accessible but have also fostered a deeper appreciation for the significance of the SDGs and the data that underpin them.\n\nThe SDGs indeed presented a substantial challenge, but they also brought forth remarkable advantages for the NSC. They served as a catalyst for rejuvenation and provided an invaluable opportunity for the NSC to gain prominence. The call from the United Nations to leverage official statistics as part of the SDG monitoring process breathed new life into their efforts. Another turning point for NSC was the enactment of a new Law on Official Statistics # 82 on July 8, 2019, reinforcing the drive for producing official statistics to be able to monitor the SDG progress. In embracing the SDGs, the NSC not only met a challenge head-on but also seized an opportunity to enhance its role. By aligning with the global pursuit of sustainable development and contributing their expertise in official statistics, they have played a significant role in shaping the nation's future and have risen to prominence on both national and international stages.\n\n_â_I believe that all of the NSC's efforts in making data and the SDGs relevant have contributed greatly to the understanding of the role of statistics and data in evidence-based management decision-making_â_, shares Nazira.\n\n**Words of Wisdom for the World**\n\nNazira leaves us with invaluable recommendations for other countries embarking or continuing their SDG voyage. They are regular engagement with users, tapping into international wisdom by studying best international practices and recommendations and applying them, enhancing statistical capacity across all domains and the system, and embracing diverse data sources.\n\nIn conclusion, the Kyrgyz Republic's voyage toward sustainable development is inspirational, illustrating that progress thrives on collaboration, innovation, and the unwavering dedication of individuals like Nazira Kerimalieva. As we continue this global pursuit of a better world, let's learn from their story and amplify our efforts to make sustainable development a reality for all.\n\n_\\*Ms. Nazira Kerimalieva is the_

Through her dedication and guidance of others, the National Statistical Committee has made significant strides in implementing Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) monitoring mechanisms.\n\nThe Kyrgyz Republic has applied a unique approach to monitoring SDG indicators, focusing on multi-stakeholder engagement, communication, and innovation, and setting a benchmark for many aspiring nations in the pursuit of achieving SDGs. Nazira has passionately shared with UN SDG:Learn valuable insights from their voyage.\n\n**The Kyrgyz Approach to SDG Monitoring**\n\nAs soon as the Kyrgyz Republic committed to its international obligations to implement the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the National Statistical Committee has been diligently engaged in establishing a comprehensive framework for tracking progress and reporting on SDG indicators. Embarking on a proactive mission, the NSC carried out a thorough assessment and adaptation of a big set of SDG indicators while concurrently formulating domestic indicators tailored to the country's unique context.\n\nFrom the outset, the Kyrgyz Republic adopted a multi-stakeholder approach to the SDG implementation. Moreover, as Nazira shares, the SDGs were interesting to everyone and they wanted to be part of the big global endevours. Engaging and getting feedback from a wide array of stakeholders - government bodies, civil society, business, academia and media - was foundational to ensuring that No One is Left Behind. This guaranteed that all voices were heard and integrated into the SDG monitoring framework. Together with the UN Statistics Division and other international organizations and partners within the National Statistical System (NSS), the NSC organized 40 different capacity-building workshops and trainings, roundtables, and seminars (links to the event available [here](https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io/en/news/)\n).\n\n![International conference on the implementation of an SDG national monitoring system, NSO KG](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/International-conference-on-the-implementation-of-a-SDG-national-monitoring-system-NSO-KG.jpg)\n\n_International conference on the implementation of an SDG national monitoring system organized by the National Statistics Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2016._\n\nThese events were meticulously designed to serve a dual purpose. Not only did they aim to foster engagement with stakeholders, but they also functioned as valuable capacity-building exercises. The NSC made substantial efforts to enhance the overall data proficiency among its users and fellow data producers. This translated into a significant improvement in understanding and interpreting the data disseminated by NSC. In particular, the NSC played a pivotal role in elevating awareness regarding the importance of official statistics and the specific data requirements for effective SDG monitoring. Nazira, who has been instrumental in this endeavor, pointed out the specific role of the media in disseminating information among the general public. Understanding that media operates as a distinct entity, the NSC approached its engagement with them with a tailored strategy.\n\nRecognizing that occasional disparities in data capacity might lead to varied interpretations and narratives, special training sessions were organized for media professionals. These training sessions sought to bridge the gap, with participants being divided into groups based on their interests and preferences. Each group had a dedicated representative from the NSC to collaborate in developing content enriched with statistical data. The outcome of this engagement with the media was overwhelmingly positive, underlining the significance of building their statistical capabilities. Furthermore, the NSC maintains a regular line of communication with the media through press conferences, sharing insights into the overarching socio-economic trends and the progress made towards achieving the SDGs and other key national indicators. This has fostered a network of media representatives who remain closely connected with the NSC, contributing to a more informed and data-savvy society. The media has published numerous [news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Izjq75qiXYA)\n about the work of the NSC on the SDGs.\n\n![Screenshot from the YouTube Channel of the State Kyrgyz Media âAla-Too 24â.](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Screenshot-from-the-YouTube-Channel-of-the-State-Kyrgyz-Media-%E2%80%9CAla-Too-24%E2%80%9D.jpg)\n\n_Screenshot from the YouTube Channel of the State Kyrgyz Media âAla-Too 24â. News coverage about the first VNR of the Kyrgyz Republic, 2020._\n\nIn an earnest pursuit of transparency and collaboration, a dedicated working group has been established to cater to the needs of data users. This group comprises representatives from a wide spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, businesses, civil society, media, and the academic community. The primary aim of this initiative is to create a platform for regular exchanges and feedback, fostering an environment of constructive dialogue. This commendable effort is not a standalone activity but supplements the existing Council of Statistics, which already includes the representatives above, including the media. These dual structures contribute significantly to ensuring that data users, with their diverse perspectives and interests, are actively engaged in the decision-making processes and the development of data-related strategies.\n\nFurthermore, recognizing the importance of enhancing the overall national capacity of the statistical system and fostering innovative ideas for refining the SDG monitoring system, the NSC, alongside other stakeholders, engaged in international workshops, seminars, and training sessions. These international platforms offered a valuable opportunity not only to learn from the successful experiences of others but also to share their own insights that could prove beneficial to fellow participants. This global interaction is a powerful reminder of the significance of looking beyond one's own system and national boundaries, Nazira shares. The exchange of knowledge and experiences on the international stage plays a pivotal role in steering progress toward the SDGs and enhancing the effectiveness of data monitoring efforts. It underscores the NSC's commitment to embracing a global perspective in their pursuit of sustainable development.\n\nThe whole SDG journey, however, was not devoid of challenges. The expansive nature of the SDGs demanded an increase in capacity and a move towards innovative data collection methods. The National Statistical Committee has been working on the seamless integration of SDG indicators into the existing statistical reporting system. As emphasized by Nazira, this is no fleeting endeavor, nor is it the sole responsibility of one department. Instead, it is an ongoing collective effort that demands the active participation of all stakeholders to stay in sync with the ever-evolving landscape of new developments, best practices, data collection methods, and data sources. While one department may act as a coordinator, the success of this endeavor hinges on the involvement of all parties. Each individual contribution, no matter how small, contributes to a larger collective effort.\n\nIn the pursuit of effectively monitoring the SDGs, the NSC embraced the challenge of tracking new indicators. These indicators encompass a diverse range of data, from assessing access to electricity to the availability of mobile phones and bank cards. To ensure the quality and consistency of this data, the NSC worked closely with government agencies, providing them with standardized templates for the collection of metadata and metrics. A substantial portion of this data is generously shared by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Natural Resources, Ecology, and Technical Supervision.\n\nNevertheless, as NSC treads further into this intricate landscape, they acknowledge that the existing resources within the statistical system, including administrative data, have their limits. To address this, NSC initiated an exploration of innovative and non-traditional data sources. As part of a collaborative effort with the UN Statistics Division (UNSD) and Statistics Norway, training on use of geospatial data was conducted. This is particularly crucial as some indicators can only be effectively tracked through the use of geospatial data. In line with the SDG geospatial framework and overall goals of integration of geospatial and statistical training, both NSC and the National Geospatial Information Agency were trained, and data-sharing mechanisms were discussed. Kyrgyzstan was one of the first countries to make use of the SDG geospatial framework.\n\nAdditionally, NSC is delving into another promising avenue of data collection - citizen data. Collaborating with the UNSD as part of the Data, for Now, initiative, they are actively exploring the utilization of this valuable resource to enhance their understanding of the progress toward the SDGs. These initiatives reflect their commitment to leveraging the power of innovation and non-traditional data sources in the pursuit of a sustainable future.\n\nFor the Kyrgyz Republic, overall innovation is a driving force for progress. Through joint support from the UNSD and the Office of National Statistics of the UK, the country established a [comprehensive platform](https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io/en/)\n for data and metadata dissemination. This platform offers dynamic data visualization in the form of graphs, data, and metadata for each indicator, both global and national ones, as well as supporting modern machine-readable data formats - a leap forward in data accessibility. Nazira points out that the Kyrgyz Republic was one of the pilot countries to produce data in SDMX format.\n\n![Screenshot of the SDG Platform of the Kyrgyz Republic.](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Screenshot-of-the-SDG-Platform-of-the-Kyrgyz-Republic.jpg)\n\n_Screenshot of the SDG Platform of the Kyrgyz Republic._\n\nThe National Statistical Committee's publications, presented in engaging infographics, have further democratized access to information. These publications not only include data but also detailed methodology and trends of the indicators, making the data comprehensible and actionable for a broader audience. These publications are not standard publications of the NSC.\n\nThe NSC has prepared a [number of statistical publications](https://sustainabledevelopment-kyrgyzstan.github.io/en/publications/)\n in such new formats. They are:\n\n*   âMonitoring SDG indicators in the Kyrgyz Republic, 2014-2018â,\n*   âStatistics of the Sustainable Development Goals in the Kyrgyz Republic, 2014-2020â,\n*   âSustainable Development Goals and Youth in the Kyrgyz Republic, 2012-2021â,\n*   âGender and Sustainable Development Goals, 2014-2021â.\n\nThe NSC was instrumental in the preparation of the first National Voluntary Review (VNR) on the SDG progress by supplying the data from the SDG platform and publications for the report. Kyrgyzstan, a trailblazer in its own right, presented its first VNR in 2020. This review showcased the nation's commitment, challenges, successes, and future directions. It covered 16 SDGs except for Goal 14 due to irrelevancy to the country. As the process and presentation of VNR coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, the report included also information on measures taken by the country to fight the pandemic.\n\nNazira emphasized the importance of continuous collaboration with different stakeholders and leveraging international best practices in the preparation of the national review as well. In the lead-up to the VNR preparation events, the voice of civil society emerged as a prominent and impassioned one. They expressed a strong desire to see their data included in the VNR report. However, it became evident that the data they presented was not comprehensive, lacked national coverage, or did not align with the established methodology for the SDGs. It was imperative to engage in a thoughtful dialogue to convey the nuances of these limitations. The NSC worked diligently to reach a consensus with civil society stakeholders. The decision centered on the utilization of official statistics for the core VNR report, while civil society data would be incorporated as illustrative cases.\n\nAs the Kyrgyz Republic gears up for its second VNR, the NSC, in partnership with the UNSD, is proactively embarking on an exploration of the potential incorporation of citizen data into the report. This forward-looking initiative reflects a commitment to expanding the scope and depth of data sources, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of the nation's progress toward the SDGs.\n\nOverall, the SDG monitoring propelled the Kyrgyz statistical system to evolve and communicate more effectively with more users and other data providers. According to Nazira, the impact of the SDGs extended far beyond just data collection. It brought about a perceptible shift in how the National Statistical Committee was perceived, significantly elevating its authority, influence, and trust levels among users, government bodies, and the general public. This shift in perception marked a turning point. People began to view the NSC through a different lens, recognizing the intrinsic value of the statistics it produced and the pivotal role it played in guiding the nation's development. The government itself embraced the data generated by the SDG platform, incorporating it into its reporting and decision-making processes on a regular basis.\n\nNazira emphasizes the paramount importance of producing \"fit-for-purpose\" data that genuinely serve the needs of users. This underscores the essential requirement for continuous capacity building to ensure that the data generated are not only accurate but also practical and valuable for those who rely on them. The NSC recognized the significance of effective communication and knowledge-sharing with various audiences. To this end, the government, users, and the wider public have benefited from a series of informative videos created by the NSC, which shed light on the SDGs and how to interpret and utilize them effectively. These videos come in various formats, including succinct clips suitable for social media platforms and longer, more in-depth presentations for those seeking a comprehensive understanding. Moreover, the inclusion of QR codes in the videos, as well as in NSC's brochures and publications, has proven useful in enhancing engagement and interest among users and the public. These multimedia resources have not only made data more accessible but have also fostered a deeper appreciation for the significance of the SDGs and the data that underpin them.\n\nThe SDGs indeed presented a substantial challenge, but they also brought forth remarkable advantages for the NSC. They served as a catalyst for rejuvenation and provided an invaluable opportunity for the NSC to gain prominence. The call from the United Nations to leverage official statistics as part of the SDG monitoring process breathed new life into their efforts.

experience of the ISLP\n====================================================================================================================\n\nMicrolearning\n\n ![UN SDG:Learn logo](https://www.unsdglearn.org/img/logo_sdglearn_white.svg) Blog\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n*   ![Pedro Campos](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_fit_200_200/Pedro-Campos-500x500.jpg) Pedro Campos Deputy-Director of the International Statistical Literacy Project (ISLP), Director of Methodology in Statistics Portugal\n\n![ISLP](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/transforms/unsdglearn/image/_crop_500_280/ISLP.jpg)\n\nThis blog is about the International Statistical Literacy Project (ISLP) and its efforts to promote statistical literacy globally. The ISLP focuses on fostering awareness and skills in statistical education through online resources, outreach activities, and international competitions.\n\nThe primary goal of the International Statistical Literacy Project (ISLP) is to foster statistical literacy globally, targeting both youth and adults in various spheres of life. In pursuit of this objective, we offer an online collection of international resources and updates related to Statistical Literacy, organize international initiatives to amplify awareness about these resources, and highlight the individuals and institutions supporting them. Additionally, we conduct outreach activities to enhance overall awareness of statistical literacy.\n\nAmong the most important activities are international competitions. International competitions serve as a benchmark for evaluating the state of statistical literacy globally. They highlight the strengths and areas for improvement in statistical education and practice across different regions. By showcasing successful solutions and best practices, these competitions offer valuable insights that can inform educational programs, policies, and methodologies. This benchmarking process contributes to the development of standardized approaches to statistical literacy, ensuring a consistent and high-quality level of education worldwide. ISLP international competitions serve as a powerful catalyst for promoting statistical literacy globally by engaging a diverse audience, facilitating skill development and learning exchange, establishing benchmarks and best practices, motivating individuals, and building a collaborative global community dedicated to advancing statistical knowledge.\n\nInternational competitions attract participants from diverse backgrounds and regions, fostering a global community of individuals interested in statistical literacy. This engagement helps raise awareness about the importance of statistical skills on a worldwide scale. Participants and observers become part of a shared initiative that transcends geographic boundaries, emphasizing the universal relevance of statistical literacy in various contexts.\n\nOn the other hand, competitions provide a platform for participants to enhance their statistical skills through practical application. By tackling real-world problems and datasets, participants not only reinforce their theoretical knowledge but also gain valuable hands-on experience. The competitive nature encourages continuous learning and drives participants to explore innovative approaches. Furthermore, these events facilitate the exchange of diverse statistical techniques and methodologies, creating a rich learning environment where participants can draw inspiration from each other's insights and strategies.\n\nThere are two competitions organized by the ISLP: the International Poster Competition, and the Best Cooperative Project Award.\n\n**International Poster competition**\n\nThe ISLP Poster Competition encourages participants to create statistical posters on topics of their choice. These posters should involve the use, analysis, and interpretation of statistics. Originality is emphasized, and participants are required to use new posters that have not been previously submitted to international competitions. The language of the poster can be either the participant's own or English.\n\nParticipants can either collect their own data or use data from reliable published sources, ensuring proper evaluation of source reliability and inclusion of references. Posters must avoid personal information about participants or institutions. Submissions are made to country coordinators, with national juries selecting the best entries for the international competition. Posters can be submitted in paper or PDF format, adhering to specified size and margin guidelines. Participation is in teams of 1-5 students, with no participation fee. There are three categories: lower secondary schools, upper secondary schools, and universities/universities of applied sciences (Bachelor level students). Lower and upper secondary school teams are registered by teachers or faculty staff, while university-level participants contact country coordinators for registration.\n\nAs an example, let me show you a poster that became the result of the experience of Ecuador. Between November 2022 and April 2023, 254 Ecuadorian students from schools enthusiastically participated in the competition. Supported by the Ecuadorian Statistical Society (SEE), this event saw collaboration with the Datalat Foundation and the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Ecological Transition.\n\n![What type of waste do you produce the most?](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/What-type-of-waste-do-you-produce-the-most.jpg)\n\n**Best Cooperative Project Award**\n\nThe Best Cooperative Project Award in Statistical Literacy is awarded every two years, in recognition of outstanding, innovative, and influential statistical literacy projects that affect a broad segment of the general public and are the fruit of the cooperation of different types of institutions (national statistical offices, schools, statistical societies, media, libraries etc.)\n\nThe last winner (2023 edition) was âWhat's Going On In This Graph?â, a collaboration of the American Statistical Association and the New York Times Learning Network. âWhat's Going On In This Graph?â is an online, free weekly educational feature. Students are asked to share with their classmates and online what they notice and wonder about a previously published graph that relates to their world. Other students and live teacher moderators reply.\n\n![What's going on in this graph?](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/Whats-going-on-in-this-graph-NYT.jpg)\n\nIn this case, it is suggested that after looking closely at the graph above (or at this [full-size image](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/12/07/learning/SantaGraph2LN/SantaGraph2LN-superJumbo.png)\n), students should answer these four questions:\n\n*   What do you notice?\n\n*   What do you wonder?\n\n*   How does this relate to you and your community?\n\n*   Create a catchy headline that captures the graphâs main idea.\n\nThe great idea behind these competitions is that competing on an international stage motivates individuals to excel in the field of statistics. The recognition associated with winning or even participating in such competitions acknowledges the efforts and skills of participants. This recognition serves as a powerful incentive, inspiring individuals to pursue careers or further education in statistics. Additionally, it promotes the importance of statistical literacy as a key skill set, encouraging a broader audience to recognize its significance in various professional and academic domains.\n\nFurthermore, international competitions create a sense of community among statisticians, educators, and learners worldwide. Participants often form networks, share experiences, and collaborate on future projects. This collaborative spirit strengthens the global statistical community, fostering a culture of knowledge exchange and cooperation. The relationships built during these competitions contribute to ongoing efforts to advance statistical literacy, with participants becoming ambassadors for the cause in their respective regions.\n\n_\\*Â Mr.Â Pedro Campos is Deputy-Director of the International Statistical Literacy Project, and leads the team of Statistical Literacy at GIST, where he helps promote statistical literacy worldwide._\n\n_Pedro is currently Director of Methodology in Statistics Portugal.

Supported by the Ecuadorian Statistical Society (SEE), this event saw collaboration with the Datalat Foundation and the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Ecological Transition.\n\n![What type of waste do you produce the most?](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/What-type-of-waste-do-you-produce-the-most.jpg)\n\n**Best Cooperative Project Award**\n\nThe Best Cooperative Project Award in Statistical Literacy is awarded every two years, in recognition of outstanding, innovative, and influential statistical literacy projects that affect a broad segment of the general public and are the fruit of the cooperation of different types of institutions (national statistical offices, schools, statistical societies, media, libraries etc.)\n\nThe last winner (2023 edition) was âWhat's Going On In This Graph?â, a collaboration of the American Statistical Association and the New York Times Learning Network. âWhat's Going On In This Graph?â is an online, free weekly educational feature. Students are asked to share with their classmates and online what they notice and wonder about a previously published graph that relates to their world. Other students and live teacher moderators reply.\n\n![What's going on in this graph?](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/Whats-going-on-in-this-graph-NYT.jpg)\n\nIn this case, it is suggested that after looking closely at the graph above (or at this [full-size image](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2023/12/07/learning/SantaGraph2LN/SantaGraph2LN-superJumbo.png)\n), students should answer these four questions:\n\n*   What do you notice?\n\n*   What do you wonder?\n\n*   How does this relate to you and your community?\n\n*   Create a catchy headline that captures the graphâs main idea.\n\nThe great idea behind these competitions is that competing on an international stage motivates individuals to excel in the field of statistics. The recognition associated with winning or even participating in such competitions acknowledges the efforts and skills of participants. This recognition serves as a powerful incentive, inspiring individuals to pursue careers or further education in statistics. Additionally, it promotes the importance of statistical literacy as a key skill set, encouraging a broader audience to recognize its significance in various professional and academic domains.\n\nFurthermore, international competitions create a sense of community among statisticians, educators, and learners worldwide. Participants often form networks, share experiences, and collaborate on future projects. This collaborative spirit strengthens the global statistical community, fostering a culture of knowledge exchange and cooperation. The relationships built during these competitions contribute to ongoing efforts to advance statistical literacy, with participants becoming ambassadors for the cause in their respective regions.\n\n_\\*Â Mr.Â Pedro Campos is Deputy-Director of the International Statistical Literacy Project, and leads the team of Statistical Literacy at GIST, where he helps promote statistical literacy worldwide._\n\n_Pedro is currently Director of Methodology in Statistics Portugal.

This blog outlines the approach taken by the Development Counts project to address this challenge, based on combining technical data skills training with opportunities for international collaboration.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG17: Partnerships for the goals Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\nSDG 17: Capacity-building\n\nSDG 17: Systemic Issues\n\nSubject\n\nData skills, learning and training\n\nKeywords\n\ndata skills\n\ndata literacy\n\ndata\n\ndata for development\n\nAs an academic engaged in quantitative global health research and responsible for quantitative methods training for social science students, it is not uncommon to have students (and indeed colleagues) tell me they are _âallergic to mathsâ_ and _âavoid statistics at all costsâ_. This is a reflection of a phenomenon well documented in the pedagogic literature as âstatistical anxietyâ : â_the apprehension that occurs when an individual is exposed to statistics content or problems and instructional situations, or evaluative contexts that deal with statisticsâ_ (Macher et al., 2015, p. 1). Such anxiety has been linked to a lack of confidence, particularly amongst students with a limited mathematical background and/or who have had bad experiences of mathematics teaching earlier in their education (Hodgen, 2010). Additional barriers to engagement in data education can be a simple lack of interest and perceived relevance to their aspirations (Carter et al., 2017, Chamberlain et al., 2015).\n\nHowever, at the same time, many of the same individuals have ambitions to contribute to global social justice. Sustainable development is amongst the areas seeking to harness the potential of the rapidly growing quantity and forms of data available globally - as exemplified by the United Nations calling for a âData Revolutionâ in development and a target in the Sustainable Development Goals explicitly on statistical capacity and data availability (Goal 17, Target 18). Human skills and judgement play a critical role at all stages of working with data from the data collection and decisions over categorisation, to interpretation and visualisation, to communicating often complex findings to non-specialists. Therefore, there is a clear need for individuals with training in real world issues and critical thinking skills to engage with data - the very same groups of social science students and academics that may be sceptical about statistics.\n\nHaving swapped stories of âstatistical anxietyâ amongst students and colleagues with research collaborators from around the world, it was clear to me that it is an international issue â and that in itself might be part of the solution. Thus the âDevelopment Countsâ project was born: an initiative which aimed to address statistical anxiety head-on by combining data skills training with the opportunity to work in international teams â another critical skill for those seeking to make a difference globally, and one which is often more sought after and relished. The project brought together teams from Gazi Ãniversitesi (Turkey), L-UniversitÃ  taâ Malta (Malta) Universidad Nacional de EducaciÃ³n a Distancia (UNED, Spain) and my own institution â the University of Gloucestershire in the UK - to work on creating these opportunities for our students and in doing so grow enthusiasm for using data and data skills to support global social justice. The project was generously supported by the ERASMUS+ programme of the European Union. Partners were deliberately chosen to ensure socio-economic and cultural diversity amongst those in countries eligible for ERASMUS+ funding. Weâve also ensured the project initiates conversations on data training for development across world regions, through outlets like this blog.\n\nAddressing the issue that learners often do not see the relevance of data skills to their aspirations, the project began with expert in-depth interviews with development professionals about current and future data skills needs. This enabled us to design the learning programme to meet those needs and very clearly link the content to employer preferences for learners so they could appreciate its value for their development. Key insights from the interviews were:\n\n*   A consistent acknowledgement of the potential of data & that greater use of data âis comingâ\n*   Enthusiasm for the potential of data science but also a clear need for broader data literacy\n*   Varied views on preferred software, but emphasis on widely available programmes particularly Microsoft Excel and open source programmes such as R\n*   High value attached to effective data visualisation & communication to non-specialists\n*   Data skills are only useful if they are grounded in real world contexts\n\nA full analysis of the interviews has been published in Open Access format in the Journal of International Development: [Bringing about the data revolution in development: What data skills do aspiring development professionals need?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jid.3642)\n\nThese insights formed the foundation of the learning programme. One of the interviewees encouraged the team to â_open the appetiteâ_ of future professionals to the possibilities of data for global development â mastering some basics and developing confidence to deepen and expand their skills in the future as whatâs possible to achieve with data evolves. In a rapidly changing data landscape and against a backdrop of a common lack of confidence working with data amongst learners, the project team thought this was a great metaphor for what the programme should try to achieve. âOpening the Appetiteâ became the theme for the programme â with each module relating to a stage in preparing a meal:\n\n1) Opening the Appetite: Whatâs the potential of data skills for global development?\n\n2) Assembling the Ingredients: How can we source data?\n\n3) Preparing the Meal: How can we analyse and visualise our data?\n\n4) Digesting the Meal: How to communicate our findings and ensure they are used for high quality decision making?\n\n5) Still Hungry: Where can we find resources to further develop our data skills?\n\nThere are three components to delivering the modules:\n\n*   PART 1: Online self-study course organised into 5 modules to introduce key material\n*   PART 2: Online live tutor-led activities to extend and consolidate learning from self-study modules and support team building\n*   PART 3: Activities to support learners to complete remote team projects, applying their learning to real world development data scenarios whilst developing cross-cultural teamwork and communication skills.\n\nThe programme was designed for groups of undergraduates students from different institutions to complete together online over a one-week period. However, it is also possible to mix and match the parts of the learning resources that are most suitable, and the resources may appeal to others interested in data for development learning too.\n\nAll parts of the training programme were piloted in September 2021 with students at the project partner universities. Undoubtedly the opportunity for international collaboration was a key reason we received many more applications from excellent candidates than we were able to offer places on the pilot programme to. However, once we had students on board for the pilot programme, much of the fantastic feedback we received noted the mix of developing technical data skills with opportunities for international collaboration â highlighting that this is a recipe for success in enthusing non-specialists about data and data skills for global social justice:\n\n_âThe course was beyond perfect. I really enjoyed working on R although it was challenging. The lessons were simple and fun.â_\n\nAyana Onurlu, pilot programme participant & undergraduate student at Gazi Ãniversitesi, Turkey\n\n_âIt has been a very interesting experience! I would like to highlight the international aspect of the course. It has been very satisfying to work with people from different countries. In addition, we have been able to deepen a relevant project with current and real problems. A very dynamic and well-organised training.â_\n\nElena Dacal Picazo, pilot programme participant & undergraduate student at Universidad Nacional de EducaciÃ³n a Distancia, Spain\n\n_âThe style in teaching data made it more interesting and being given chances to work internationally on data is something I think many people would benefit fromâ_\n\nMolly Gregory, pilot programme participant & undergraduate student at the University of Gloucestershire, United Kingdom.\n\nAs well as benefiting the students, the project created new connections between academics at the partner universities and enabled us to share data skills â learning new techniques from each other, as well as strategies for overcoming âstatistical anxietyâ in our students and colleagues. Following the pilot, the programme has been refined based on student and staff feedback before being made available on the [project website](https://uniofglos.blog/dataskills/)\n and the [UN SDG:Learn platform](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/opening-the-appetite-data-skills-for-global-development-training-programme/)\n in English, Spanish and Turkish.\n\n_\\*Â Dr. Rachel Bennett is a Senior Lecturer in Human Geography at the University of Gloucestershire, specializing in population health and migration in Sub-Saharan Africa.

This blog outlines the approach taken by the Development Counts project to address this challenge, based on combining technical data skills training with opportunities for international collaboration.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG17: Partnerships for the goals Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\nSDG 17: Capacity-building\n\nSDG 17: Systemic Issues\n\nSubject\n\nData skills, learning and training\n\nKeywords\n\ndata skills\n\ndata literacy\n\ndata\n\ndata for development\n\nAs an academic engaged in quantitative global health research and responsible for quantitative methods training for social science students, it is not uncommon to have students (and indeed colleagues) tell me they are _âallergic to mathsâ_ and _âavoid statistics at all costsâ_. This is a reflection of a phenomenon well documented in the pedagogic literature as âstatistical anxietyâ : â_the apprehension that occurs when an individual is exposed to statistics content or problems and instructional situations, or evaluative contexts that deal with statisticsâ_ (Macher et al., 2015, p. 1). Such anxiety has been linked to a lack of confidence, particularly amongst students with a limited mathematical background and/or who have had bad experiences of mathematics teaching earlier in their education (Hodgen, 2010). Additional barriers to engagement in data education can be a simple lack of interest and perceived relevance to their aspirations (Carter et al., 2017, Chamberlain et al., 2015).\n\nHowever, at the same time, many of the same individuals have ambitions to contribute to global social justice. Sustainable development is amongst the areas seeking to harness the potential of the rapidly growing quantity and forms of data available globally - as exemplified by the United Nations calling for a âData Revolutionâ in development and a target in the Sustainable Development Goals explicitly on statistical capacity and data availability (Goal 17, Target 18). Human skills and judgement play a critical role at all stages of working with data from the data collection and decisions over categorisation, to interpretation and visualisation, to communicating often complex findings to non-specialists. Therefore, there is a clear need for individuals with training in real world issues and critical thinking skills to engage with data - the very same groups of social science students and academics that may be sceptical about statistics.\n\nHaving swapped stories of âstatistical anxietyâ amongst students and colleagues with research collaborators from around the world, it was clear to me that it is an international issue â and that in itself might be part of the solution. Thus the âDevelopment Countsâ project was born: an initiative which aimed to address statistical anxiety head-on by combining data skills training with the opportunity to work in international teams â another critical skill for those seeking to make a difference globally, and one which is often more sought after and relished. The project brought together teams from Gazi Ãniversitesi (Turkey), L-UniversitÃ  taâ Malta (Malta) Universidad Nacional de EducaciÃ³n a Distancia (UNED, Spain) and my own institution â the University of Gloucestershire in the UK - to work on creating these opportunities for our students and in doing so grow enthusiasm for using data and data skills to support global social justice. The project was generously supported by the ERASMUS+ programme of the European Union. Partners were deliberately chosen to ensure socio-economic and cultural diversity amongst those in countries eligible for ERASMUS+ funding. Weâve also ensured the project initiates conversations on data training for development across world regions, through outlets like this blog.\n\nAddressing the issue that learners often do not see the relevance of data skills to their aspirations, the project began with expert in-depth interviews with development professionals about current and future data skills needs. This enabled us to design the learning programme to meet those needs and very clearly link the content to employer preferences for learners so they could appreciate its value for their development. Key insights from the interviews were:\n\n*   A consistent acknowledgement of the potential of data & that greater use of data âis comingâ\n*   Enthusiasm for the potential of data science but also a clear need for broader data literacy\n*   Varied views on preferred software, but emphasis on widely available programmes particularly Microsoft Excel and open source programmes such as R\n*   High value attached to effective data visualisation & communication to non-specialists\n*   Data skills are only useful if they are grounded in real world contexts\n\nA full analysis of the interviews has been published in Open Access format in the Journal of International Development: [Bringing about the data revolution in development: What data skills do aspiring development professionals need?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jid.3642)\n\nThese insights formed the foundation of the learning programme. One of the interviewees encouraged the team to â_open the appetiteâ_ of future professionals to the possibilities of data for global development â mastering some basics and developing confidence to deepen and expand their skills in the future as whatâs possible to achieve with data evolves. In a rapidly changing data landscape and against a backdrop of a common lack of confidence working with data amongst learners, the project team thought this was a great metaphor for what the programme should try to achieve. âOpening the Appetiteâ became the theme for the programme â with each module relating to a stage in preparing a meal:\n\n1) Opening the Appetite: Whatâs the potential of data skills for global development?\n\n2) Assembling the Ingredients: How can we source data?\n\n3) Preparing the Meal: How can we analyse and visualise our data?\n\n4) Digesting the Meal: How to communicate our findings and ensure they are used for high quality decision making?\n\n5) Still Hungry: Where can we find resources to further develop our data skills?\n\nThere are three components to delivering the modules:\n\n*   PART 1: Online self-study course organised into 5 modules to introduce key material\n*   PART 2: Online live tutor-led activities to extend and consolidate learning from self-study modules and support team building\n*   PART 3: Activities to support learners to complete remote team projects, applying their learning to real world development data scenarios whilst developing cross-cultural teamwork and communication skills.\n\nThe programme was designed for groups of undergraduates students from different institutions to complete together online over a one-week period. However, it is also possible to mix and match the parts of the learning resources that are most suitable, and the resources may appeal to others interested in data for development learning too.\n\nAll parts of the training programme were piloted in September 2021 with students at the project partner universities. Undoubtedly the opportunity for international collaboration was a key reason we received many more applications from excellent candidates than we were able to offer places on the pilot programme to. However, once we had students on board for the pilot programme, much of the fantastic feedback we received noted the mix of developing technical data skills with opportunities for international collaboration â highlighting that this is a recipe for success in enthusing non-specialists about data and data skills for global social justice:\n\n_âThe course was beyond perfect. I really enjoyed working on R although it was challenging. The lessons were simple and fun.â_\n\nAyana Onurlu, pilot programme participant & undergraduate student at Gazi Ãniversitesi, Turkey\n\n_âIt has been a very interesting experience! I would like to highlight the international aspect of the course. It has been very satisfying to work with people from different countries. In addition, we have been able to deepen a relevant project with current and real problems. A very dynamic and well-organised training.â_\n\nElena Dacal Picazo, pilot programme participant & undergraduate student at Universidad Nacional de EducaciÃ³n a Distancia, Spain\n\n_âThe style in teaching data made it more interesting and being given chances to work internationally on data is something I think many people would benefit fromâ_\n\nMolly Gregory, pilot programme participant & undergraduate student at the University of Gloucestershire, United Kingdom.\n\nAs well as benefiting the students, the project created new connections between academics at the partner universities and enabled us to share data skills â learning new techniques from each other, as well as strategies for overcoming âstatistical anxietyâ in our students and colleagues. Following the pilot, the programme has been refined based on student and staff feedback before being made available on the [project website](https://uniofglos.blog/dataskills/)\n and the [UN SDG:Learn platform](https://www.unsdglearn.org/courses/opening-the-appetite-data-skills-for-global-development-training-programme/)\n in English, Spanish and Turkish.\n\n_\\*Â Dr. Rachel Bennett is a Senior Lecturer in Human Geography at the University of Gloucestershire, specializing in population health and migration in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The Statistical Training Assessment Tool can support national statistical offices in identifying, prioritizing and meeting training needs and establishing a training programme.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG17: Partnerships for the goals Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\nSDG 17: Capacity-building\n\nSDG 17: Systemic Issues\n\nSubject\n\nData and statistics for SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\nNational Statistical Office\n\nNational Statistical Systems\n\ncapacity building\n\nstatistical training\n\nassessment tool\n\nThe quality of a countryâs official statistics depends to a large degree on the capabilities of the staff working in the national statistical system. Making sure that staff has adequate skills is crucial and should be a priority of those institutions working with the production of official statistics. Training in needed skills can improve performance and productivity and help the institutions meet both current, new, and future requirements. For the individual staff, more competence may give more satisfying and interesting work and increase responsibility. Training is an investment, and it will initially cost the working hours of the staff, but the expected return is more skilled, efficient, and motivated staff.\n\nThe Global Network of Institutions for Statistical Training (GIST) ([https://unstats.un.org/GIST](https://unstats.un.org/GIST)\n) was established in 2018 with the aim to contribute to efficient, effective, and harmonized delivery of statistical training and has in recent years worked on efforts to meet training requests of national statistical offices. A review has been conducted on how different national statistical offices approach and organise training for their staff. The analysis showed a large variation in national statistical training programmes and even a lack of a strategic approach to training in some countries. The lack of national sustainable training programmes has implications for the skill levels of staff and the ability of the national statistical office (and other institutions within the national statistical system) to develop and modernize and to meet the increasing needs of users.\n\nGIST thus recognized the need for a tool, which can help national statistical offices:\n\n*   Taking the lead in prioritization training provided to the staff, thus ensuring a holistic approach to training rather than providing training more ad-hoc based on offers available from partners\n*   Identifying the needs and gaps in skills from both a staff member and a strategic managerial perspective\n*   Prioritizing among staffâs different (and presumably many) training needs\n*   Meeting needs through own or freely available resources and support from national and international partners\n\n**The Statistical Training Assessment Tool**\n\nThe Statistical Training Assessment Tool, also known as STAT, has been developed by GIST and is intended to support national statistical offices in identifying, assessing, and meeting prioritized training needs. STAT consists of three questionnaires to assess skills levels and training needs at the national statistical office and within the national statistical system. It also provides a guidance document to support the prioritization process and establishment of a national training programme.\n\nGIST wanted to provide a tool, which the national statistical office can manage by itself. Hence STAT is owned by the national statistical office and should be locally adjusted as needed. The tool will help the national statistical office to think more strategically about training and how to set up a training programme based on staff needs. STAT further provides recommendations on how the national statistical office can prioritize among the many training needs and how to meet those needs by looking at the provision of training more broadly. The tool thus aims to inspire the national statistical office to consider both informal and formal training and the use of different training formats (online training; in-person training; self-paced training etc.). STAT can also help the national statistical office identify those training needs where support from partners such as regional and international organizations, bilateral donors, academia etc. are needed.\n\nSTAT provides an option for the national statistical office to assess skill levels and training needs within the national statistical system and support those statisticians working in the different ministries and agencies. This is particularly important for those countries where a large part of the statistics production lies with other institutions than the national statistical office.\n\nBesides focusing on the needs of staff working in statistics production, STAT also looks into the skills and training needs of staff working in administrative functions such as finance and HR. A well-functioning organization is highly dependent on efficient and smooth administrative procedures and is also key in the management of the national statistical system.\n\nThe three questionnaires address different respondents and purposes:\n\n1.  A questionnaire for all staff including managers at the national statistical office to identify the individual level of a range of skills and the training needs.\n2.  A questionnaire for managers at the national statistical office to identify gaps in their teamâs ability to perform current as well as future tasks. The questionnaire is intended to capture institutional needs based on priorities and strategies and expected future requirements.\n3.  A questionnaire for staff working with statistics production at other institutions within the national statistical system (i.e. ministries and other public institutions).\n\nThe questionnaires are developed to capture a wide range of different and cross-cutting skills. Since skills requirements can vary from country to country, the questionnaires are designed to be flexible, and can thus be accustomed to meet the specific requirements of the country by deleting or adding skills or sub-sections.\n\nSTAT is still in an early stage and is currently being piloted before a final version will be made available at the end of 2023. The national statistical offices in Colombia, Ghana, Maldives, Malawi, Mexico, and Papua New Guinea have kindly offered to pilot the tool.\n\n**How to develop a national training programme**\n\nDeciding on which training needs to prioritize and include in a training programme of the national statistical office is not an easy task. If the training needs assessment has been conducted, the result will most likely show that staff have many different training needs. The national statistical office therefore needs to prioritize among those skills and assess which are most crucial and beneficial for the organization. There are several considerations to take, and some considerations may even be in conflict with others.\n\nConsiderations include among others:\n\n*   The needs of the many staff vs few staff\n*   Training identified as high vs low priority by respondents\n*   Staff vs management identified needs\n*   Very few staff lacking knowledge in key skills\n*   New and inexperienced staff vs experienced staff\n*   The need for improvement in basic vs intermediate vs advanced skill levels\n\nOnce the national statistical office has the list of priority training, it has to decide on how the needs can be met. It therefore needs to consider what is already available, what is possible, what can be done in-house or with support from external partners and institutions.\n\nTraining should be understood as a broad term including both informal and formal training. Informal training includes on-the-job training, mentoring and participation in networks, while formal training includes facilitated and self-facilitated training as well as reading. Usually, the majority of training will be on-the-job training, while formal training will make up a smaller share of training for the individual.\n\nLack of funding is often a challenge to meet all training needs. However, the national statistical office can develop a training programme even with limited funds. Focusing on informal training such as on-the-job-training, mentoring and free e-learning as well as offering a few facilitated courses is a way to get started without making the task too overwhelming or costly.\n\nFace-to-face training has long been the preferred method of learning. However, offering e-learning expands the opportunities and is better than no training at all. The national statistical office can prioritize face-to-face training when personal interaction is crucial for the learning outcome.\n\nThe national statistical office should also consider using staff as trainers as it has many advantages. It strengthens the self-sufficiency of the organization, provide development opportunities for staff and target training to the specific needs of the organization. Thus, building a culture where staff are motivated and supported to train others is beneficial for the organization.\n\n**Training new staff is a crucial discipline**\n\nNew staff will usually be more engaged in training than more experienced staff. Since new staff will always continue to arrive in the organization, it is important to offer a set of basic training courses for new staff - even by the use of free e-learning that could be supported by an in-house facilitator to engage in discussions and clarifying questions.\n\nNewly recruited staff can be trained in the basics of official statistics, data analysis, data presentation, dissemination techniques as well as the organisation and administrative procedures of the organization. Preferably, new staff should receive training within the first year and should be given the time needed during working hours to engage in training activities whether informal or formal.\n\nIf the national statistical office has limited resources to develop training materials, it can use free e-learning to train new staff. STAT has identified a list of topics that new staff would normally need training in and has also identified relevant free e-learning resources.\n\n**What does it take to meet the training needs of staff?**\n\nManagement must be supportive of staff prioritizing training and devoting the needed time. Integrating training as part of the ordinary tasks of staff may facilitate this process. If giving and attending training is something that has to be done in addition to other tasks, it may not receive the needed attention.\n\nMoreover, management often has knowledge of existing competencies but also the needs of tomorrow and should therefore be actively engaged in identifying training needs. Management can in addition play an active role in dialogue with individual staff about his/her specific training needs thus supporting the individual in fulfilling roles and responsibilities.\n\nTraining should be considered a normal part of work and should in principle take place during working hours. Participation in training during working hours might also give female staff better opportunities to benefit. Both learners and in-house trainers need to set aside time for training and be able and willing to prioritize it over other tasks.\n\nIn general, promoting an organisational culture of training, using more experienced staff to train others, and focusing on training as a broad concept, will, in the long run, make the national statistical office and possibly the national statistical system more self-sufficient and able to meet societyâs need for high-quality statistics. Skilled staff are just more capable of carrying out their job.\n\n_\\* Ms.Â Charlotte Juul Hansen, Consultant, United Nations Statistics Division/DESA_\n\n_in collaboration with the Global Network of Institutions for Statistical Training (GIST)_\n\n_Charlotte Juul Hansen has worked for the United Nations Statistics Division in the past years.

working in the national statistical system. The Statistical Training Assessment Tool can support national statistical offices in identifying, prioritizing and meeting training needs and establishing a training programme.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG17: Partnerships for the goals Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\nSDG 17: Capacity-building\n\nSDG 17: Systemic Issues\n\nSubject\n\nData and statistics for SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\nNational Statistical Office\n\nNational Statistical Systems\n\ncapacity building\n\nstatistical training\n\nassessment tool\n\nThe quality of a countryâs official statistics depends to a large degree on the capabilities of the staff working in the national statistical system. Making sure that staff has adequate skills is crucial and should be a priority of those institutions working with the production of official statistics. Training in needed skills can improve performance and productivity and help the institutions meet both current, new, and future requirements. For the individual staff, more competence may give more satisfying and interesting work and increase responsibility. Training is an investment, and it will initially cost the working hours of the staff, but the expected return is more skilled, efficient, and motivated staff.\n\nThe Global Network of Institutions for Statistical Training (GIST) ([https://unstats.un.org/GIST](https://unstats.un.org/GIST)\n) was established in 2018 with the aim to contribute to efficient, effective, and harmonized delivery of statistical training and has in recent years worked on efforts to meet training requests of national statistical offices. A review has been conducted on how different national statistical offices approach and organise training for their staff. The analysis showed a large variation in national statistical training programmes and even a lack of a strategic approach to training in some countries. The lack of national sustainable training programmes has implications for the skill levels of staff and the ability of the national statistical office (and other institutions within the national statistical system) to develop and modernize and to meet the increasing needs of users.\n\nGIST thus recognized the need for a tool, which can help national statistical offices:\n\n*   Taking the lead in prioritization training provided to the staff, thus ensuring a holistic approach to training rather than providing training more ad-hoc based on offers available from partners\n*   Identifying the needs and gaps in skills from both a staff member and a strategic managerial perspective\n*   Prioritizing among staffâs different (and presumably many) training needs\n*   Meeting needs through own or freely available resources and support from national and international partners\n\n**The Statistical Training Assessment Tool**\n\nThe Statistical Training Assessment Tool, also known as STAT, has been developed by GIST and is intended to support national statistical offices in identifying, assessing, and meeting prioritized training needs. STAT consists of three questionnaires to assess skills levels and training needs at the national statistical office and within the national statistical system. It also provides a guidance document to support the prioritization process and establishment of a national training programme.\n\nGIST wanted to provide a tool, which the national statistical office can manage by itself. Hence STAT is owned by the national statistical office and should be locally adjusted as needed. The tool will help the national statistical office to think more strategically about training and how to set up a training programme based on staff needs. STAT further provides recommendations on how the national statistical office can prioritize among the many training needs and how to meet those needs by looking at the provision of training more broadly. The tool thus aims to inspire the national statistical office to consider both informal and formal training and the use of different training formats (online training; in-person training; self-paced training etc.). STAT can also help the national statistical office identify those training needs where support from partners such as regional and international organizations, bilateral donors, academia etc. are needed.\n\nSTAT provides an option for the national statistical office to assess skill levels and training needs within the national statistical system and support those statisticians working in the different ministries and agencies. This is particularly important for those countries where a large part of the statistics production lies with other institutions than the national statistical office.\n\nBesides focusing on the needs of staff working in statistics production, STAT also looks into the skills and training needs of staff working in administrative functions such as finance and HR. A well-functioning organization is highly dependent on efficient and smooth administrative procedures and is also key in the management of the national statistical system.\n\nThe three questionnaires address different respondents and purposes:\n\n1.  A questionnaire for all staff including managers at the national statistical office to identify the individual level of a range of skills and the training needs.\n2.  A questionnaire for managers at the national statistical office to identify gaps in their teamâs ability to perform current as well as future tasks. The questionnaire is intended to capture institutional needs based on priorities and strategies and expected future requirements.\n3.  A questionnaire for staff working with statistics production at other institutions within the national statistical system (i.e. ministries and other public institutions).\n\nThe questionnaires are developed to capture a wide range of different and cross-cutting skills. Since skills requirements can vary from country to country, the questionnaires are designed to be flexible, and can thus be accustomed to meet the specific requirements of the country by deleting or adding skills or sub-sections.\n\nSTAT is still in an early stage and is currently being piloted before a final version will be made available at the end of 2023. The national statistical offices in Colombia, Ghana, Maldives, Malawi, Mexico, and Papua New Guinea have kindly offered to pilot the tool.\n\n**How to develop a national training programme**\n\nDeciding on which training needs to prioritize and include in a training programme of the national statistical office is not an easy task. If the training needs assessment has been conducted, the result will most likely show that staff have many different training needs. The national statistical office therefore needs to prioritize among those skills and assess which are most crucial and beneficial for the organization. There are several considerations to take, and some considerations may even be in conflict with others.\n\nConsiderations include among others:\n\n*   The needs of the many staff vs few staff\n*   Training identified as high vs low priority by respondents\n*   Staff vs management identified needs\n*   Very few staff lacking knowledge in key skills\n*   New and inexperienced staff vs experienced staff\n*   The need for improvement in basic vs intermediate vs advanced skill levels\n\nOnce the national statistical office has the list of priority training, it has to decide on how the needs can be met. It therefore needs to consider what is already available, what is possible, what can be done in-house or with support from external partners and institutions.\n\nTraining should be understood as a broad term including both informal and formal training. Informal training includes on-the-job training, mentoring and participation in networks, while formal training includes facilitated and self-facilitated training as well as reading. Usually, the majority of training will be on-the-job training, while formal training will make up a smaller share of training for the individual.\n\nLack of funding is often a challenge to meet all training needs. However, the national statistical office can develop a training programme even with limited funds. Focusing on informal training such as on-the-job-training, mentoring and free e-learning as well as offering a few facilitated courses is a way to get started without making the task too overwhelming or costly.\n\nFace-to-face training has long been the preferred method of learning. However, offering e-learning expands the opportunities and is better than no training at all. The national statistical office can prioritize face-to-face training when personal interaction is crucial for the learning outcome.\n\nThe national statistical office should also consider using staff as trainers as it has many advantages. It strengthens the self-sufficiency of the organization, provide development opportunities for staff and target training to the specific needs of the organization. Thus, building a culture where staff are motivated and supported to train others is beneficial for the organization.\n\n**Training new staff is a crucial discipline**\n\nNew staff will usually be more engaged in training than more experienced staff. Since new staff will always continue to arrive in the organization, it is important to offer a set of basic training courses for new staff - even by the use of free e-learning that could be supported by an in-house facilitator to engage in discussions and clarifying questions.\n\nNewly recruited staff can be trained in the basics of official statistics, data analysis, data presentation, dissemination techniques as well as the organisation and administrative procedures of the organization. Preferably, new staff should receive training within the first year and should be given the time needed during working hours to engage in training activities whether informal or formal.\n\nIf the national statistical office has limited resources to develop training materials, it can use free e-learning to train new staff. STAT has identified a list of topics that new staff would normally need training in and has also identified relevant free e-learning resources.\n\n**What does it take to meet the training needs of staff?**\n\nManagement must be supportive of staff prioritizing training and devoting the needed time. Integrating training as part of the ordinary tasks of staff may facilitate this process. If giving and attending training is something that has to be done in addition to other tasks, it may not receive the needed attention.\n\nMoreover, management often has knowledge of existing competencies but also the needs of tomorrow and should therefore be actively engaged in identifying training needs. Management can in addition play an active role in dialogue with individual staff about his/her specific training needs thus supporting the individual in fulfilling roles and responsibilities.\n\nTraining should be considered a normal part of work and should in principle take place during working hours. Participation in training during working hours might also give female staff better opportunities to benefit. Both learners and in-house trainers need to set aside time for training and be able and willing to prioritize it over other tasks.\n\nIn general, promoting an organisational culture of training, using more experienced staff to train others, and focusing on training as a broad concept, will, in the long run, make the national statistical office and possibly the national statistical system more self-sufficient and able to meet societyâs need for high-quality statistics. Skilled staff are just more capable of carrying out their job.\n\n_\\* Ms.Â Charlotte Juul Hansen, Consultant, United Nations Statistics Division/DESA_\n\n_in collaboration with the Global Network of Institutions for Statistical Training (GIST)_\n\n_Charlotte Juul Hansen has worked for the United Nations Statistics Division in the past years.

Satellite imagery is promising for the calculus of SDG indicators. The UN Regional Hub for Big Data in Brazil held 2 workshops in 2023 with the purpose of identifying public spaces through geoprocessing and calculating the indicator 11.7.1.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG11: Sustainable cities and communities Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\n\nSubject\n\nData and statistics for SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\ncapacity-building\n\nbig data\n\nsatellite imagery\n\ncalculus of SDG indicators\n\nSDG indicator 11.7.1\n\nWith the rise and fast expansion of different kinds of big data, National Statistical Offices â NSOs have been challenged to incorporate such new non-traditional data into their production system, for improvement and expansion of the statistics they provide. As in other parts of the world, most NSOs in Latin America and the Caribbean are willing to incorporate the use of big data. Awareness and training initiatives are key to fostering this use. The possibility of knowledge exchange in a regional network is invaluable given that realities might be very similar, posing common challenges to different countries. The **UN Regional Hub for Big Data in Brazil** ([https://hub.ibge.gov.br/index.htm](https://hub.ibge.gov.br/index.htm)\n) has one workstream particularly turned to training and promoting the use of big data in NSOs. Its concern is to provide experimentation, hands-on experiences for the theme to be more easily grasped, shortening the way to potential application.\n\nA series of 2 workshops were planned as part of the Hubâs 2022-2023 work programme. This series stems from the preference of NSOs to start projects with big data using open data sources. Particularly, the topic of satellite imagery was cited in a consultation recently conducted in the region about the use of big data in Latin America and the Caribbean. It was pointed both as a need for development and as an existing practice for some countries.\n\nFollowing a âlearn by doingâ approach and considering the promising use of satellite imagery for the calculus of SDG indicators, the 3rd Workshop of Big Data was planned to demonstrate the use of tools to obtain and process those images (to access the recordings in Spanish, see [https://hub.ibge.gov.br/videos...](https://hub.ibge.gov.br/videos.htm)\n), while the 4th Workshop of Big Data was intended to provide a real experience of calculating one specific indicator based on the images obtained.\n\nThe 3rd Workshop was entitled âSatellite images for the calculus of the 11.7.1 SDG Indicatorâ. It took place from July 31st to August 4th, 2023. Classes happened online on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Tuesday and Thursday were used for exercises and clarification of doubts. At the end of this workshop, participants would be able to do the image acquisition for determining the average proportion of built-up surface, considered open space of public usage in the cities. Participants were invited to experience what was demonstrated and were continuously monitored in their progress.\n\nThe 4th Workshop was entitled âPublic Space Identification and Calculus of the 11.7.1 SDG Indicatorâ. It took place in an in-person modality to enable close monitoring of development, but also a more significant networking and exchange of knowledge, aiming at promoting partnerships among countries in the region. It happened from August 29th to 31st, 2023. At the end of this workshop, participants would be able to identify the urban areas and public spaces through geoprocessing, and calculate the average proportion of built-up surface, considered open space of public usage in the cities.\n\n![Facilitators constantly monitored participantsâ activities and classmates discussed their practices. 4th Workshop.

Bogota, Colombia, August, 2023.\n\nThe 3rd Workshop posed the challenge of reconciling two countries in the production of content and preparation for instruction: Paraguay and Colombia. The meetings to define the learning objectives and the syllabus were crucial for the best arrangement of the planning and for a satisfactory design of the workshop. The instructors also did rehearsals of their classes, so that everyone could comment. This was an important opportunity to adjust issues of content and the best pedagogical strategy. Two specialists in geosciences from IBGE participated in the elaboration of the workshop content. A specialist from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) also participated in the discussions and offered some existing material of their own as a starting point for the elaboration of slides.\n\nFour months of work to plan and design classes were necessary before the implementation of the workshop. The meetings took place virtually with participants from INE/Paraguay, Dane/Colombia, ECLAC and IBGE/Brazil. In parallel to the 3rd Workshop, Dane/Colombia worked for two months on the organization of the 4th Workshop to start a month later. The Hub supported this work with communication actions and provided references on the logistics of the event based on its previous experiences.\n\nParticipants were very active in class, asking questions and clarifying doubts, and engaged in the production of the exercises. Instructors were diligent in correcting and giving feedback to participants. This exchange of information required organizationâs considerable effort to ensure satisfactory communication and material access. The workshop was carried out perfectly with the support of NIC.br, with no IT incident in class streaming.\n\nThe instructors were very clear and followed the learning objectives. The classes had a significant demonstrative approach, but participants interacted actively, doing the exercises according to the demonstration. The third day had a greater demonstrative load and for this reason, 2 out of the 20 participants mentioned difficulties in following it. With the recording of the classes, though, the participants were able to review content and do the proposed tasks of extracting images. Participants declared to have used 9 hours in average for workshop completion, which is consistent with the time planned: 6 class hours and up to 4 hours for studying and exercises.\n\n![3rd Workshop of Big Data, online session.

Some possible actions are to produce a follow-up tutorial or provide a tutorial in advance and use the synchronous moment to clarify doubts. Overall, the workshop was highly praised by participants as an opportunity to advance the use of satellite images for calculating SDG indicators. The highlight was Dane/Colombia and INE/Paraguayâs diligent efforts in the preparation, execution, and evaluation of the exercises.\n\nThe 4th Workshop was organized two months earlier with the greatest effort from Dane/Colombia. The Regional Hub organizer shared previous experiences with Dane regarding the elaboration of the workshop agenda, practical information, as well as a checklist of items to consider for the implementation of the in-presence classes.

They received financial support from the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB).\n\nThe use of free software was another positive feedback extracted from the reaction assessment. Participants pointed some remaining needs of development in the area: data source; big data tools; applications of machine learning; managing and exporting statistical data from census and surveys applying big data; artificial intelligence applications such as _tensorflow_ and _google colab_; cloud and distributed processing using big data tools (Apache sparke); infrastructure to process big data; non-traditional data sources for the calculus of indicators; satellite images for official statistics.\n\nAn impact assessment is predicted for November 2023 to see how countries advanced with the knowledge acquired in their NSOs. It will be possible to know if they engaged in the calculation of the 11.7.1 indicator or if they transferred skills to other SDG indicators. DANE Colombia took profit from the workshop and showed how they have advanced in the production and monitoring of SDG indicators (see [https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/servicios-al-ciudadano/servicios-informacion/objetivos-de-desarrollo-sostenible-ods](https://www.dane.gov.co/index.php/servicios-al-ciudadano/servicios-informacion/objetivos-de-desarrollo-sostenible-ods)\n). From this interesting presentation, not by chance connected to the 4th Workshop, one can easily be convinced by the idea that to advance with SDG indicators it is necessary to advance, in turn, with experimental statistics. Big data, alternative data sources and innovative methods may contribute to this end.

challenged to work with new non-traditional data. Satellite imagery is promising for the calculus of SDG indicators. The UN Regional Hub for Big Data in Brazil held 2 workshops in 2023 with the purpose of identifying public spaces through geoprocessing and calculating the indicator 11.7.1.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG11: Sustainable cities and communities Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\n\nSubject\n\nData and statistics for SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\ncapacity-building\n\nbig data\n\nsatellite imagery\n\ncalculus of SDG indicators\n\nSDG indicator 11.7.1\n\nWith the rise and fast expansion of different kinds of big data, National Statistical Offices â NSOs have been challenged to incorporate such new non-traditional data into their production system, for improvement and expansion of the statistics they provide. As in other parts of the world, most NSOs in Latin America and the Caribbean are willing to incorporate the use of big data. Awareness and training initiatives are key to fostering this use. The possibility of knowledge exchange in a regional network is invaluable given that realities might be very similar, posing common challenges to different countries. The **UN Regional Hub for Big Data in Brazil** ([https://hub.ibge.gov.br/index.htm](https://hub.ibge.gov.br/index.htm)\n) has one workstream particularly turned to training and promoting the use of big data in NSOs. Its concern is to provide experimentation, hands-on experiences for the theme to be more easily grasped, shortening the way to potential application.\n\nA series of 2 workshops were planned as part of the Hubâs 2022-2023 work programme. This series stems from the preference of NSOs to start projects with big data using open data sources. Particularly, the topic of satellite imagery was cited in a consultation recently conducted in the region about the use of big data in Latin America and the Caribbean. It was pointed both as a need for development and as an existing practice for some countries.\n\nFollowing a âlearn by doingâ approach and considering the promising use of satellite imagery for the calculus of SDG indicators, the 3rd Workshop of Big Data was planned to demonstrate the use of tools to obtain and process those images (to access the recordings in Spanish, see [https://hub.ibge.gov.br/videos...](https://hub.ibge.gov.br/videos.htm)\n), while the 4th Workshop of Big Data was intended to provide a real experience of calculating one specific indicator based on the images obtained.\n\nThe 3rd Workshop was entitled âSatellite images for the calculus of the 11.7.1 SDG Indicatorâ. It took place from July 31st to August 4th, 2023. Classes happened online on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Tuesday and Thursday were used for exercises and clarification of doubts. At the end of this workshop, participants would be able to do the image acquisition for determining the average proportion of built-up surface, considered open space of public usage in the cities. Participants were invited to experience what was demonstrated and were continuously monitored in their progress.\n\nThe 4th Workshop was entitled âPublic Space Identification and Calculus of the 11.7.1 SDG Indicatorâ. It took place in an in-person modality to enable close monitoring of development, but also a more significant networking and exchange of knowledge, aiming at promoting partnerships among countries in the region. It happened from August 29th to 31st, 2023. At the end of this workshop, participants would be able to identify the urban areas and public spaces through geoprocessing, and calculate the average proportion of built-up surface, considered open space of public usage in the cities.\n\n![Facilitators constantly monitored participantsâ activities and classmates discussed their practices. 4th Workshop.

Bogota, Colombia, August, 2023.\n\nThe 3rd Workshop posed the challenge of reconciling two countries in the production of content and preparation for instruction: Paraguay and Colombia. The meetings to define the learning objectives and the syllabus were crucial for the best arrangement of the planning and for a satisfactory design of the workshop. The instructors also did rehearsals of their classes, so that everyone could comment. This was an important opportunity to adjust issues of content and the best pedagogical strategy. Two specialists in geosciences from IBGE participated in the elaboration of the workshop content. A specialist from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) also participated in the discussions and offered some existing material of their own as a starting point for the elaboration of slides.\n\nFour months of work to plan and design classes were necessary before the implementation of the workshop. The meetings took place virtually with participants from INE/Paraguay, Dane/Colombia, ECLAC and IBGE/Brazil. In parallel to the 3rd Workshop, Dane/Colombia worked for two months on the organization of the 4th Workshop to start a month later. The Hub supported this work with communication actions and provided references on the logistics of the event based on its previous experiences.\n\nParticipants were very active in class, asking questions and clarifying doubts, and engaged in the production of the exercises. Instructors were diligent in correcting and giving feedback to participants. This exchange of information required organizationâs considerable effort to ensure satisfactory communication and material access. The workshop was carried out perfectly with the support of NIC.br, with no IT incident in class streaming.\n\nThe instructors were very clear and followed the learning objectives. The classes had a significant demonstrative approach, but participants interacted actively, doing the exercises according to the demonstration. The third day had a greater demonstrative load and for this reason, 2 out of the 20 participants mentioned difficulties in following it. With the recording of the classes, though, the participants were able to review content and do the proposed tasks of extracting images. Participants declared to have used 9 hours in average for workshop completion, which is consistent with the time planned: 6 class hours and up to 4 hours for studying and exercises.\n\n![3rd Workshop of Big Data, online session.

countries and it can contribute to jobs creation bringing prosperity to emerging economies if properly used._\n> \n> _Marco Kamiya, UNIDO, Chief of Digital Transformation and AI Strategies at UNIDO, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization_\n\nThe American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald said that the test of first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function, and this line is relevant when we refer to Artificial Intelligence, as the debate is lopsided toward a negative narrative. A critical view prevails that focuses on the effects of AI on privacy, profiling, and disinformation, eroding human rights, and through replacement of labor will cause unemployment and inequality.\n\nAll sensible organizations -and the United Nations has a key role- must be aware of the potential ethical effects of technologies and possible misuse of AI[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1)\n. But the cons must be balanced by the pros so that policymakers can act on an essential element: applying AI technologies to economic transformation. We think that AI is one of the critical technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and corporations and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from emerging countries must advance in applying AI to productive activities.\n\nTo support SMEs and productive transformation in developing countries, we need to take into account the following: (i) the changing nature of productive activities beyond manufacturing; (ii) the exponential growth of digitalization and AI; and (iii) the practical uses and applications of AI for productive activities.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/Blog-AI-and-SMEs-scaled-aspect-ratio-1920-1080-scaled.jpg)\n\nSmart industry robot arms for digital factory production technology showing automation manufacturing process of the Industry 4.0 or 4th industrial revolution and IOT software to control operation .\n\n**AI Beyond Manufacturing**\n\nArtificial Intelligence is the ability of a system, a computer, or a robot to learn, performing tasks usually done by humans with the capacity to perceive, decide, reason, and act. Examples of AI applications are in production robots, smart assistants, self-driving cars, automated financial analysis and investing, social media monitoring, and travel booking agents among others.\n\nAI is part of the Advanced Digital Production (ADP) technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (UNIDO 2019). Other technologies in this group include big data analytics, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), advanced robotics, and additive printing manufacturing. A major feature of these technologies is their combinatorial effects and exponential growth.\n\nWhen applied to manufacturing, AI allows firms to reduce costs, simplify processes, streamline supply chains, and save resources. AI, for example, enhances predictive machine maintenance, anticipates quality, minimizes scrap, increases defect zero yields, forecasts components demand, and estimates inventories. AI in services is also revolutionizing responses with chatbot customer support, reducing client service costs, expanding hourly attention times to 24 hours, and predicting customersâ needs.\n\nAlso, digitalization and AI are changing classical taxonomies. Productive activities used to be classified as Primary, agriculture and raw materials; Secondary, manufacturing and material processing; and Tertiary, services, distribution, and logistics activities. The eruption of new digital technologies and AI is changing that demarcation, where in the past there was a clear separation between manufacturing and services, today there are the digital platforms, the ubiquitous Amazon, Airbnb, Uber, Alibaba, Baidu, and the numerous local platforms and services that we find in countries all over the world. This reallocation of productive activities has implications for measurement and policies.\n\nOn quantification, digital platforms are still to be defined for statistical purposes. UNIDO, a custodian of statistical data on production, only covers âso farâ manufacturing and produces a stylized database of manufacturing value added[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2)\n. Manufacturing is not just the production of physical goods, but it is increasingly combined with services and digital platforms. This feature of the digital economy that UNCTAD labels as âplatformizationâ is ubiquitous, including firms in developing countries[\\[3\\]](#_ftn3)\n. The World Bank calculates that digital technologies make up almost 15% of the global product. The World Economic Forum says that in 2025 the value of the digital economy will be 20% of the global GDP. Â When we turn to AI technologies, -machines performing human cognitive functions,- measuring is even more difficult, though some estimates situate the AI market size to be USD 93.5 billion in 2021 and are set to expand to 38% by 2030[\\[4\\]](#_ftn4)\n. There is no systematic methodology to measure the digital economy; the numbers may be much higher, as research-based estimations of consumersâ willingness to pay show[\\[5\\]](#_ftn5)\n.\n\nOn policy, though the historical role of manufacturing in development is key, new questions arise: Should we look closely at the potential role of services for growth in developing countries? (Think about India, Mexico, Tunisia or Uzbekistan), would âplatformizationâ be a way to accelerate productivity in Least Developed Countries? (Think about providing local firms access to technologies and markets) Should Middle-Income Countries aggressively digitalize and use frontier technologies to insert firms into global production platforms?Â  (Think about Argentina, Egypt and Indonesia), All these questions are waiting for answers while, as we speak, AI and digitalization advance at exponential speed.\n\n**The Need for Speed**\n\nIn 2005, futurologist Ray Kurzweil wrote in âThe Singularity is Nearâ[\\[6\\]](#_ftn6)\n that with the law of accelerated returns, advances like computers, biotech, nanotechnologies, nanosensors, robotics and artificial intelligence will get to a point where humans and machines will integrate, that stage will be the âsingularityâ and will occur in 2045. The statement has always been difficult to subscribe to, just considering that energy is not an infinite resource, or climate change, which worsens with unmanaged economic growth can be a major constraint. However, the speed at which technologies are evolving is just overwhelming. Things difficult to do are being done as we pass the days. In a must-read 2021 book on the history of Artificial Intelligence, Oxford University professor Michael Wooldridge listed activities ânowhere near solvedâ[\\[7\\]](#_ftn7)\n, such as understanding stories and answering questions about them; human-level translation; interpreting a photograph; writing journalistic stories; interpreting art. As of today, in 2022, progress in this area is undeniably impressive; an MIT team is creating images from stories[\\[8\\]](#_ftn8)\n; Translation apps are improving every day the conversion of spoken languages, and robots are learning how to tell jokes[\\[9\\]](#_ftn9)\n. Â A machine will not produce a Picassoâs Guernica, but in a very short time, those tasks that seemed very remote in the future are becoming part of our lives.\n\nCompanies in developing countries are learning to cope with speed and increasingly using AI in production activities. China is one of the leaders using AI in a large range of sectors from production, distribution to urban planning[\\[10\\]](#_ftn10)\n; in Brazil, the Alice Assistant developed by the startup such as Solintec, is being used by farming and agriculture small and medium size enterprises to improve harvesting processes[\\[11\\]](#_ftn11)\n; In Nigeria, RxAll has developed an application to detect fake drugs; in India, there are an increasing number of startups working in AI[\\[12\\]](#_ftn12)\n.\n\nHowever, in most of the developing world, for small and medium-size enterprises, it is still a challenge to plan for digitalization and apply AI to production or supply chain activities (UNIDO 2019, 2022[\\[13\\]](#_ftn13)\n; UNCTAD 2021[\\[14\\]](#_ftn14)\n). Several issues stay such as proper knowledge of the technology, financial resources, skills, absorption capabilities, and technology availability as well as proper legal frameworks to incorporate the new technologies. This is also an issue for small firms in high-income countries, but note that an SME in a high-income country, may just decide not to change, and no need to digitalize or use AI, as they occupy a niche and have a distinctive competitive advantage, just consider that some of the small companies in countries like Germany and Japan have been there for more than 100 years, and they supply precision components to large corporations or produce something that none is able to produce. On the contrary, an SME in a developing country is certainly small, without knowledge or resources to embark on overarching transformations.\n\nFor those small firms in the developing world, it is necessary to provide knowledge of the potential of digital tools, cost-benefit analysis, and availability of global and regional technologies. When AI advances faster, understanding its potential and applications to firm productivity is essential. Failure to address this may lead to an AI divide, where advances based on basic research and science cannot be absorbed by developing countries due to a weak ecosystem and lack of proper innovation policies.\n\n**Think in Potentials**\n\nWhen it comes to AI, it is essential not to become a technology âludditeâ -somebody who dismisses and negates new technologies-, AI will make some jobs redundant but will create new ones that require decision-making and creativity. AI may make goods and services cheaper by reducing production costs and making distribution faster and less expensive and will create new positions in teaching and training and, by pairing technologies like the Metaverse, can eventually expand educational contents and knowledge.\n\nAI and digital transformation are needed to provide solutions to climate and the environment, energy efficiency, food production, urban-rural disparities, and city management. In developing countries, firms must have access to know-how and data, as well as to basic sciences being developed in universities and research centers in the North. Based on UNIDOâs technical cooperation[\\[15\\]](#_ftn15)\n, Table 1 provides a list of applications that SMEs and entrepreneurs may potentially design in emerging markets. These applications do not require access to complex neural networks, basic science, and can use advanced sensors and actuators imported from elsewhere.\n\nA major risk in developing countries is for their firms to be unable to absorb and manage the digital and AI revolution. Digitalization and AI can become sources of competitiveness and equalizers of societies if used smartly. The AI divide may become one of the major obstacles in the developing world, so awareness and a concerted effort is needed to rise the levers of growth.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Table-1.-Examples-of-Potential-AI-Applications-from-Developing-Countries.jpg)\n\n**Ideas for Policy Design**\n\nWhen it comes to policy, it is commonplace to list a menu of activities that countries must follow, but this frequently becomes a mechanical exercise (be aware that the Theory of Change[\\[16\\]](#_ftn16)\n is not an end but an instrument). Letâs try something different, pointing to some necessary areas of interventions[\\[17\\]](#_ftn17)\n, on examples of what is being done to advance on better policy design.\n\n**1\\. Redoubling efforts to understand the context for the application of digitalization and AI**\n\nWhen it comes to firms and the state of technologies, not all firms are alike, as they belong to regions, have different income levels, and possess different kinds of industries. For policies, a proper assessment must take into account regions, countries, and even cities. Â Regarding income levels, the exercise also identifies differences across regions, such as being a high-income country, a middle-income country, or Least Developed Country (LDCs). High-income countries possess frontier technologies and firms where digitalization and AI technologies are locally available; middle-income countries have strong capacities but do not yet have access to frontier technologies, and in LDCs absorption and skills of new technologies is a major bottleneck. Â UNIDO is conducting a consultation and analysis of digitalization and the use of technology in production is five regions: Asia-Pacific; Latin America; Arab States; Africa; Europe and Central Asia.\n\n**2\\. Support permanent building and rebuilding of the Innovation Ecosystems**\n\nStrengthening and building innovation ecosystems is a permanent task. A project funded by Slovenia in Serbia in the Western Balkans, focuses on creating a Smart Manufacturing Center to train firms on digital technologies. Slovenia has an integrated industry and academia system, and is providing Serbia with expertise to expand innovation ecosystem and extend it to the Western Balkans. Â One component of the project is to advance on science and technology parks that uses virtual teams and communications tools to develop regional and global clusters of expertise. Digital twining tools combined with digital training may revolutionize the traditional physical âdevelopment parksâ approach which not always work.\n\n**3\\. Advance in measuring the digital economy and AI**\n\nIn a recent visit to Saudi Arabia for a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, we saw countries working together on design and application of digital readiness for firms. This is a priority as countries need to be able to measure to establish baselines to track progress.Â  At the firm level, countries demand quick and practical tools to understand digitalization, AI and know the options and technologies available. UNIDO has developed a set of tools for governments and is perfecting others for firms. More is needed, however when it comes to AI and the industry, as the applications of AI are becoming more necessary and important for firms to maintain competitiveness.\n\n**4\\. Apply training and entrepreneurship for digital transformation**\n\nWhen it comes to AI, a precondition to advance is that digital transformation is already understood and in place by local firms. This is not true, our consultations show that firms even in high-income countries donât understand the benefits of digitalization. In emerging economies upgrading skills and spreading knowledge are essential before expanding into more complex areas such as AI for production.Â  A UNIDO project in Tunisia and Cote DâIvoire supported by German cooperation is working with local firms on Smart Manufacturing, training youth in alliance with university and nurturing an entrepreneurial ecosystem.Â Â  In the same way, on Energy, UNIDO is supporting start-ups and SMEs that apply digital transformation and frontier information and communication technologies to contribute to clean energy transition and climate action through the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme (GCIP) in 15 countries.\n\n**5\\. Apply new technologies to solve global challenges**\n\nAI and digital tools can be applied to map and analyze territories. UNIDO is developing a model to support the Mediterranean aquaculture transition towards sustainable and circular practices. Artificial Intelligence enables the optimization of the FCR (Feed Conversion Ratio), a key parameter for resource-efficient aquaculture. Using underwater 360Â° cameras, the system analyses fish behavior, satiety and automatically detects free pellets to provide inputs signals to automatic feeders and optimize feed rations reducing the dispersion of foreign substances in marine ecosystems.\n\n**6\\. Rethinking non-manufacturing sectors, agriculture and mining**\n\nDeveloping countries rely on raw materials produced by agriculture, mining sectors, and marine resources. Those are not sophisticated manufacturing sectors, but it may be a potential source of growth with new technologies. In Namibia, AI and associated satellite imagery technologies are been used to combat invasive species and thus improve food security, enabling yield prediction for farmers and indicating where harvesters can find the bushes and get rid of them. Â Mining, which is a premiere raw commodity sector, should also be reexamined as a potential for development. Mining usually relies on hundreds of SMEs, but the value and ecosystem are not well connected or work with old technologies, so the copper giant in Chile, Codelco embarked on digital transformation upscaling production with robotics, AI and Big Data and improving cybersecurity and procurement, scaling efficiency working with suppliers which are largely SMEs, the Codelco case was even selected as a Case Study at Harvard Business School. Marine resources, with long coastlines in developing countries, may also be developed and managed with satellite imagery and big data analysis.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** As digital transformation and AI advance is inevitable, the ultimate terminus is not foreseeable.

countries and it can contribute to jobs creation bringing prosperity to emerging economies if properly used._\n> \n> _Marco Kamiya, UNIDO, Chief of Digital Transformation and AI Strategies at UNIDO, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization_\n\nThe American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald said that the test of first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function, and this line is relevant when we refer to Artificial Intelligence, as the debate is lopsided toward a negative narrative. A critical view prevails that focuses on the effects of AI on privacy, profiling, and disinformation, eroding human rights, and through replacement of labor will cause unemployment and inequality.\n\nAll sensible organizations -and the United Nations has a key role- must be aware of the potential ethical effects of technologies and possible misuse of AI[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1)\n. But the cons must be balanced by the pros so that policymakers can act on an essential element: applying AI technologies to economic transformation. We think that AI is one of the critical technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, and corporations and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) from emerging countries must advance in applying AI to productive activities.\n\nTo support SMEs and productive transformation in developing countries, we need to take into account the following: (i) the changing nature of productive activities beyond manufacturing; (ii) the exponential growth of digitalization and AI; and (iii) the practical uses and applications of AI for productive activities.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/image/Blog-AI-and-SMEs-scaled-aspect-ratio-1920-1080-scaled.jpg)\n\nSmart industry robot arms for digital factory production technology showing automation manufacturing process of the Industry 4.0 or 4th industrial revolution and IOT software to control operation .\n\n**AI Beyond Manufacturing**\n\nArtificial Intelligence is the ability of a system, a computer, or a robot to learn, performing tasks usually done by humans with the capacity to perceive, decide, reason, and act. Examples of AI applications are in production robots, smart assistants, self-driving cars, automated financial analysis and investing, social media monitoring, and travel booking agents among others.\n\nAI is part of the Advanced Digital Production (ADP) technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (UNIDO 2019). Other technologies in this group include big data analytics, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), advanced robotics, and additive printing manufacturing. A major feature of these technologies is their combinatorial effects and exponential growth.\n\nWhen applied to manufacturing, AI allows firms to reduce costs, simplify processes, streamline supply chains, and save resources. AI, for example, enhances predictive machine maintenance, anticipates quality, minimizes scrap, increases defect zero yields, forecasts components demand, and estimates inventories. AI in services is also revolutionizing responses with chatbot customer support, reducing client service costs, expanding hourly attention times to 24 hours, and predicting customersâ needs.\n\nAlso, digitalization and AI are changing classical taxonomies. Productive activities used to be classified as Primary, agriculture and raw materials; Secondary, manufacturing and material processing; and Tertiary, services, distribution, and logistics activities. The eruption of new digital technologies and AI is changing that demarcation, where in the past there was a clear separation between manufacturing and services, today there are the digital platforms, the ubiquitous Amazon, Airbnb, Uber, Alibaba, Baidu, and the numerous local platforms and services that we find in countries all over the world. This reallocation of productive activities has implications for measurement and policies.\n\nOn quantification, digital platforms are still to be defined for statistical purposes. UNIDO, a custodian of statistical data on production, only covers âso farâ manufacturing and produces a stylized database of manufacturing value added[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2)\n. Manufacturing is not just the production of physical goods, but it is increasingly combined with services and digital platforms. This feature of the digital economy that UNCTAD labels as âplatformizationâ is ubiquitous, including firms in developing countries[\\[3\\]](#_ftn3)\n. The World Bank calculates that digital technologies make up almost 15% of the global product. The World Economic Forum says that in 2025 the value of the digital economy will be 20% of the global GDP. Â When we turn to AI technologies, -machines performing human cognitive functions,- measuring is even more difficult, though some estimates situate the AI market size to be USD 93.5 billion in 2021 and are set to expand to 38% by 2030[\\[4\\]](#_ftn4)\n. There is no systematic methodology to measure the digital economy; the numbers may be much higher, as research-based estimations of consumersâ willingness to pay show[\\[5\\]](#_ftn5)\n.\n\nOn policy, though the historical role of manufacturing in development is key, new questions arise: Should we look closely at the potential role of services for growth in developing countries? (Think about India, Mexico, Tunisia or Uzbekistan), would âplatformizationâ be a way to accelerate productivity in Least Developed Countries? (Think about providing local firms access to technologies and markets) Should Middle-Income Countries aggressively digitalize and use frontier technologies to insert firms into global production platforms?Â  (Think about Argentina, Egypt and Indonesia), All these questions are waiting for answers while, as we speak, AI and digitalization advance at exponential speed.\n\n**The Need for Speed**\n\nIn 2005, futurologist Ray Kurzweil wrote in âThe Singularity is Nearâ[\\[6\\]](#_ftn6)\n that with the law of accelerated returns, advances like computers, biotech, nanotechnologies, nanosensors, robotics and artificial intelligence will get to a point where humans and machines will integrate, that stage will be the âsingularityâ and will occur in 2045. The statement has always been difficult to subscribe to, just considering that energy is not an infinite resource, or climate change, which worsens with unmanaged economic growth can be a major constraint. However, the speed at which technologies are evolving is just overwhelming. Things difficult to do are being done as we pass the days. In a must-read 2021 book on the history of Artificial Intelligence, Oxford University professor Michael Wooldridge listed activities ânowhere near solvedâ[\\[7\\]](#_ftn7)\n, such as understanding stories and answering questions about them; human-level translation; interpreting a photograph; writing journalistic stories; interpreting art. As of today, in 2022, progress in this area is undeniably impressive; an MIT team is creating images from stories[\\[8\\]](#_ftn8)\n; Translation apps are improving every day the conversion of spoken languages, and robots are learning how to tell jokes[\\[9\\]](#_ftn9)\n. Â A machine will not produce a Picassoâs Guernica, but in a very short time, those tasks that seemed very remote in the future are becoming part of our lives.\n\nCompanies in developing countries are learning to cope with speed and increasingly using AI in production activities. China is one of the leaders using AI in a large range of sectors from production, distribution to urban planning[\\[10\\]](#_ftn10)\n; in Brazil, the Alice Assistant developed by the startup such as Solintec, is being used by farming and agriculture small and medium size enterprises to improve harvesting processes[\\[11\\]](#_ftn11)\n; In Nigeria, RxAll has developed an application to detect fake drugs; in India, there are an increasing number of startups working in AI[\\[12\\]](#_ftn12)\n.\n\nHowever, in most of the developing world, for small and medium-size enterprises, it is still a challenge to plan for digitalization and apply AI to production or supply chain activities (UNIDO 2019, 2022[\\[13\\]](#_ftn13)\n; UNCTAD 2021[\\[14\\]](#_ftn14)\n). Several issues stay such as proper knowledge of the technology, financial resources, skills, absorption capabilities, and technology availability as well as proper legal frameworks to incorporate the new technologies. This is also an issue for small firms in high-income countries, but note that an SME in a high-income country, may just decide not to change, and no need to digitalize or use AI, as they occupy a niche and have a distinctive competitive advantage, just consider that some of the small companies in countries like Germany and Japan have been there for more than 100 years, and they supply precision components to large corporations or produce something that none is able to produce. On the contrary, an SME in a developing country is certainly small, without knowledge or resources to embark on overarching transformations.\n\nFor those small firms in the developing world, it is necessary to provide knowledge of the potential of digital tools, cost-benefit analysis, and availability of global and regional technologies. When AI advances faster, understanding its potential and applications to firm productivity is essential. Failure to address this may lead to an AI divide, where advances based on basic research and science cannot be absorbed by developing countries due to a weak ecosystem and lack of proper innovation policies.\n\n**Think in Potentials**\n\nWhen it comes to AI, it is essential not to become a technology âludditeâ -somebody who dismisses and negates new technologies-, AI will make some jobs redundant but will create new ones that require decision-making and creativity. AI may make goods and services cheaper by reducing production costs and making distribution faster and less expensive and will create new positions in teaching and training and, by pairing technologies like the Metaverse, can eventually expand educational contents and knowledge.\n\nAI and digital transformation are needed to provide solutions to climate and the environment, energy efficiency, food production, urban-rural disparities, and city management. In developing countries, firms must have access to know-how and data, as well as to basic sciences being developed in universities and research centers in the North. Based on UNIDOâs technical cooperation[\\[15\\]](#_ftn15)\n, Table 1 provides a list of applications that SMEs and entrepreneurs may potentially design in emerging markets. These applications do not require access to complex neural networks, basic science, and can use advanced sensors and actuators imported from elsewhere.\n\nA major risk in developing countries is for their firms to be unable to absorb and manage the digital and AI revolution. Digitalization and AI can become sources of competitiveness and equalizers of societies if used smartly. The AI divide may become one of the major obstacles in the developing world, so awareness and a concerted effort is needed to rise the levers of growth.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Table-1.-Examples-of-Potential-AI-Applications-from-Developing-Countries.jpg)\n\n**Ideas for Policy Design**\n\nWhen it comes to policy, it is commonplace to list a menu of activities that countries must follow, but this frequently becomes a mechanical exercise (be aware that the Theory of Change[\\[16\\]](#_ftn16)\n is not an end but an instrument). Letâs try something different, pointing to some necessary areas of interventions[\\[17\\]](#_ftn17)\n, on examples of what is being done to advance on better policy design.\n\n**1\\. Redoubling efforts to understand the context for the application of digitalization and AI**\n\nWhen it comes to firms and the state of technologies, not all firms are alike, as they belong to regions, have different income levels, and possess different kinds of industries. For policies, a proper assessment must take into account regions, countries, and even cities. Â Regarding income levels, the exercise also identifies differences across regions, such as being a high-income country, a middle-income country, or Least Developed Country (LDCs). High-income countries possess frontier technologies and firms where digitalization and AI technologies are locally available; middle-income countries have strong capacities but do not yet have access to frontier technologies, and in LDCs absorption and skills of new technologies is a major bottleneck. Â UNIDO is conducting a consultation and analysis of digitalization and the use of technology in production is five regions: Asia-Pacific; Latin America; Arab States; Africa; Europe and Central Asia.\n\n**2\\. Support permanent building and rebuilding of the Innovation Ecosystems**\n\nStrengthening and building innovation ecosystems is a permanent task. A project funded by Slovenia in Serbia in the Western Balkans, focuses on creating a Smart Manufacturing Center to train firms on digital technologies. Slovenia has an integrated industry and academia system, and is providing Serbia with expertise to expand innovation ecosystem and extend it to the Western Balkans. Â One component of the project is to advance on science and technology parks that uses virtual teams and communications tools to develop regional and global clusters of expertise. Digital twining tools combined with digital training may revolutionize the traditional physical âdevelopment parksâ approach which not always work.\n\n**3\\. Advance in measuring the digital economy and AI**\n\nIn a recent visit to Saudi Arabia for a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, we saw countries working together on design and application of digital readiness for firms. This is a priority as countries need to be able to measure to establish baselines to track progress.Â  At the firm level, countries demand quick and practical tools to understand digitalization, AI and know the options and technologies available. UNIDO has developed a set of tools for governments and is perfecting others for firms. More is needed, however when it comes to AI and the industry, as the applications of AI are becoming more necessary and important for firms to maintain competitiveness.\n\n**4\\. Apply training and entrepreneurship for digital transformation**\n\nWhen it comes to AI, a precondition to advance is that digital transformation is already understood and in place by local firms. This is not true, our consultations show that firms even in high-income countries donât understand the benefits of digitalization. In emerging economies upgrading skills and spreading knowledge are essential before expanding into more complex areas such as AI for production.Â  A UNIDO project in Tunisia and Cote DâIvoire supported by German cooperation is working with local firms on Smart Manufacturing, training youth in alliance with university and nurturing an entrepreneurial ecosystem.Â Â  In the same way, on Energy, UNIDO is supporting start-ups and SMEs that apply digital transformation and frontier information and communication technologies to contribute to clean energy transition and climate action through the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme (GCIP) in 15 countries.\n\n**5\\. Apply new technologies to solve global challenges**\n\nAI and digital tools can be applied to map and analyze territories. UNIDO is developing a model to support the Mediterranean aquaculture transition towards sustainable and circular practices. Artificial Intelligence enables the optimization of the FCR (Feed Conversion Ratio), a key parameter for resource-efficient aquaculture. Using underwater 360Â° cameras, the system analyses fish behavior, satiety and automatically detects free pellets to provide inputs signals to automatic feeders and optimize feed rations reducing the dispersion of foreign substances in marine ecosystems.\n\n**6\\. Rethinking non-manufacturing sectors, agriculture and mining**\n\nDeveloping countries rely on raw materials produced by agriculture, mining sectors, and marine resources. Those are not sophisticated manufacturing sectors, but it may be a potential source of growth with new technologies. In Namibia, AI and associated satellite imagery technologies are been used to combat invasive species and thus improve food security, enabling yield prediction for farmers and indicating where harvesters can find the bushes and get rid of them. Â Mining, which is a premiere raw commodity sector, should also be reexamined as a potential for development. Mining usually relies on hundreds of SMEs, but the value and ecosystem are not well connected or work with old technologies, so the copper giant in Chile, Codelco embarked on digital transformation upscaling production with robotics, AI and Big Data and improving cybersecurity and procurement, scaling efficiency working with suppliers which are largely SMEs, the Codelco case was even selected as a Case Study at Harvard Business School. Marine resources, with long coastlines in developing countries, may also be developed and managed with satellite imagery and big data analysis.\n\n**The Bottom Line:** As digital transformation and AI advance is inevitable, the ultimate terminus is not foreseeable. Though a Terminator-like future may be imagined for entertainment, that scenario is beyond the immediate control of humanity, nevertheless, developing countries should make major efforts to understand and apply the new technologies for productive transformation (maybe supporting national AI initiatives for industries). Â Having two opposite ideas may be a useful principle for decision-making in the AI era; this is urgent, as emerging countries should avoid a new divide.\n\n_\\* Mr. Marco Kamiya is Chief of the Division of Digital Transformation and Artificial Intelligence Strategies at UNIDO, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.

Sustainability\n=====================================================\n\nMicrolearning\n\n ![UN SDG:Learn logo](https://www.unsdglearn.org/img/logo_sdglearn_white.svg) Blog\n\nAuthors\n-------\n\n*

increasingly complex and transnational challenges. It is critical to understand how companies of all sizes can build their resilience to these shocks, seize opportunities that might arise from such shifts and enhance their ability to generate long-term and sustainable value.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nSDG17: Partnerships for the goals Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\nSDG 17: Capacity-building\n\nSubject\n\nSMEs and the implementation of the SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\nSMEs\n\nsustainability\n\nBusinesses are facing increasingly complex and transnational challenges. These include the growing impacts of climate change, technological disruption, socioeconomic stratification and related social unrest, the rise of conflict and its ripple effects on energy and food security, as well as changing expectations about the role of business in society. As we imagine the future, it is critical to understand how companies of all sizes can build their resilience to these shocks, seize opportunities that might arise from such shifts and enhance their ability to generate long-term and sustainable value.\n\nSMEs represent around 90% of all firms worldwide, employ roughly 70% of the global workforce and, by some estimates, contribute up to 70% of global GDP. Unlike larger corporations, their size makes them more agile in producing and integrating innovations. These businesses play significant roles â not only in the global economy and labour markets â but also in enabling and shaping the nature of innovation within those markets. Despite their unique contributions, SMEs also face specific challenges, often closely tied to their survival, that have not been widely examined within the context of their future readiness. While SMEs can benefit from higher degrees of speed and agility, they can face constraints due to their smaller size and resource access. Given these challenges and opportunities, it is important to better understand the role and positioning of SMEs in creating and maintaining momentum to achieve widespread positive social, environmental and economic change, not only today, but most importantly, for the long-term future. This requires SMEs to support sustainability broadly but also to ensure their environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives are centralized within broader business strategy and, ideally, linked to the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nTo enable SMEs and mid-sized companies to improve their chances of success while generating a positive impact in the future, they need to be future-ready. The ability to identify opportunities to enhance future readiness not only supports SMEs themselves, but society as a whole, in terms of job creation, inclusive growth, sustainable development, or all three. Future readiness is defined by the [World Economic Forum](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_Readiness_of_SMEs_2021.pdf)\n as a set of organizational capabilities and orientations that enable companies to successfully respond to shocks and seize opportunities that emerge from constant disruption. To develop a comprehensive understanding of future readiness, the Forum applied several research methodologies and identified the following as the three core characteristics of future-ready SMEs: the ability to generate sustained growth; the ability to have a positive social and environmental impact; and the ability to remain resilient and agile in times of volatility. The Forumâs research also identifies three key drivers of future-readiness which include 1) **orientation**, the culture and style through which important decisions are taken, 2) **business model** flexibility and 3) the ability to establish and tap into valuable **networks** and connections. The Forum provides access to a self-assessment tool for SMEs to benchmark their future-readiness in comparison to their peers. This can be accessed [here](https://initiatives.weforum.org/future-readiness-best-practices/benchmarking-tool)\n.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Drivers-of-Future-readiness.jpg)\n\nIn addition to these efforts, in 2020, [UpLink](https://uplink.weforum.org/uplink/s/)\n, the open innovation platform of the World Economic Forum was launched with the mission to create bridges within the innovation ecosystem for entrepreneurs to connect to investors, corporates, experts, and other organizations they need to scale. UpLink has been crucial in supporting and helping its Top Innovators scale such as:\n\n*   [EcoTree](https://uplink.weforum.org/uplink/s/uplink-contribution/a012o00001OSTEVAA5/ecotree-sustainable-forestry)\n    \n*   [Zvandiri](https://uplink.weforum.org/uplink/s/uplink-contribution/a012o00001pU7WpAAK/zvandiri-peerled-health-happiness-and-hope-for-adolescents-living-with-hiv)\n    \n*   [Algaesys](https://uplink.weforum.org/uplink/s/uplink-contribution/a012o00001pTksdAAC/algaesys)\n    \n\nAs the examples above illustrate, SMEs prioritizing societal impact can realise competitive advantages through this approach. In similar cases, sustainability concerns could form the key purpose of the business or, if not, may need to be relocated from a corporate social responsibility-style role to a central strategic consideration by upper management. Such a move would be proactive relative to climate change-related legislation (in the case of reducing carbon emissions), would offer opportunities for reputational enhancement, including through sustainability certification (such as signing the UN Global Compact or becoming a B Corp-certified corporation) and may offer access to a growing international network of organizations similarly aligned towards creating positive societal impact through their companyâs orientation and business model.\n\nGiven the huge impact COVID-19 has had on small businesses and the ongoing fallout from Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, SMEs have found themselves in a state of simply needing to survive and other objectives have fallen by the wayside. This survivalist mindset has, for example, reduced the focus on the societal impact for SMEs. In addition, many SMEs may feel underprepared to engage in sustainable practices or believe themselves to be too small to have much impact. Whereas some SMEs have sustainability as a core- or by-product of their business model, others believe they donât have the resources (financial and/or knowledge) to make this leap and are often not sure where to begin â the challenge can feel overwhelming. However, proactively addressing sustainability through innovative products or services can serve as a way to tap into new markets and minimize the increasing regulatory risks associated with not doing so. Younger workers have also shown a growing preference for engaging with mission-led companies that focus on positive societal impact. Embracing the potential strategic advantages of positive societal impact in this way offers multiple value-creating routes as well as an opportunity to gain reputational benefits as champions of the implementation of sustainability strategies. Finally, embracing sustainability and adopting future-readiness can unlock access to capital. SMEs often face a problem with securing the capital they need and, increasingly, environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards are integral to that process. Aligning with broader social and economic development goals set by governments and investors can unlock new opportunities offered by start-up accelerators, incubators and venture capitalists. Government grants are also increasingly available for companies that help a nation or region move closer to established sustainability goals.\n\nFuture-ready SMEs will need business models that affect society positively in line with ESG goals and this requires them to place such sustainability at the centre of their business strategies, with the payoffs potentially being talent acquisition and retention, access to capital and alignment with regulatory protocols and broader sustainable development goals.\n\n_\\* Ms. Bryonie Guthrie is on the Strategic Intelligence team at the World Economic Forum in Geneva, Switzerland.

increasingly complex and transnational challenges. It is critical to understand how companies of all sizes can build their resilience to these shocks, seize opportunities that might arise from such shifts and enhance their ability to generate long-term and sustainable value.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nSDG17: Partnerships for the goals Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\nSDG 17: Capacity-building\n\nSubject\n\nSMEs and the implementation of the SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\nSMEs\n\nsustainability\n\nBusinesses are facing increasingly complex and transnational challenges. These include the growing impacts of climate change, technological disruption, socioeconomic stratification and related social unrest, the rise of conflict and its ripple effects on energy and food security, as well as changing expectations about the role of business in society. As we imagine the future, it is critical to understand how companies of all sizes can build their resilience to these shocks, seize opportunities that might arise from such shifts and enhance their ability to generate long-term and sustainable value.\n\nSMEs represent around 90% of all firms worldwide, employ roughly 70% of the global workforce and, by some estimates, contribute up to 70% of global GDP. Unlike larger corporations, their size makes them more agile in producing and integrating innovations. These businesses play significant roles â not only in the global economy and labour markets â but also in enabling and shaping the nature of innovation within those markets. Despite their unique contributions, SMEs also face specific challenges, often closely tied to their survival, that have not been widely examined within the context of their future readiness. While SMEs can benefit from higher degrees of speed and agility, they can face constraints due to their smaller size and resource access. Given these challenges and opportunities, it is important to better understand the role and positioning of SMEs in creating and maintaining momentum to achieve widespread positive social, environmental and economic change, not only today, but most importantly, for the long-term future. This requires SMEs to support sustainability broadly but also to ensure their environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives are centralized within broader business strategy and, ideally, linked to the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nTo enable SMEs and mid-sized companies to improve their chances of success while generating a positive impact in the future, they need to be future-ready. The ability to identify opportunities to enhance future readiness not only supports SMEs themselves, but society as a whole, in terms of job creation, inclusive growth, sustainable development, or all three. Future readiness is defined by the [World Economic Forum](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_Readiness_of_SMEs_2021.pdf)\n as a set of organizational capabilities and orientations that enable companies to successfully respond to shocks and seize opportunities that emerge from constant disruption. To develop a comprehensive understanding of future readiness, the Forum applied several research methodologies and identified the following as the three core characteristics of future-ready SMEs: the ability to generate sustained growth; the ability to have a positive social and environmental impact; and the ability to remain resilient and agile in times of volatility. The Forumâs research also identifies three key drivers of future-readiness which include 1) **orientation**, the culture and style through which important decisions are taken, 2) **business model** flexibility and 3) the ability to establish and tap into valuable **networks** and connections. The Forum provides access to a self-assessment tool for SMEs to benchmark their future-readiness in comparison to their peers. This can be accessed [here](https://initiatives.weforum.org/future-readiness-best-practices/benchmarking-tool)\n.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Drivers-of-Future-readiness.jpg)\n\nIn addition to these efforts, in 2020, [UpLink](https://uplink.weforum.org/uplink/s/)\n, the open innovation platform of the World Economic Forum was launched with the mission to create bridges within the innovation ecosystem for entrepreneurs to connect to investors, corporates, experts, and other organizations they need to scale. UpLink has been crucial in supporting and helping its Top Innovators scale such as:\n\n*   [EcoTree](https://uplink.weforum.org/uplink/s/uplink-contribution/a012o00001OSTEVAA5/ecotree-sustainable-forestry)\n    \n*   [Zvandiri](https://uplink.weforum.org/uplink/s/uplink-contribution/a012o00001pU7WpAAK/zvandiri-peerled-health-happiness-and-hope-for-adolescents-living-with-hiv)\n    \n*   [Algaesys](https://uplink.weforum.org/uplink/s/uplink-contribution/a012o00001pTksdAAC/algaesys)\n    \n\nAs the examples above illustrate, SMEs prioritizing societal impact can realise competitive advantages through this approach. In similar cases, sustainability concerns could form the key purpose of the business or, if not, may need to be relocated from a corporate social responsibility-style role to a central strategic consideration by upper management. Such a move would be proactive relative to climate change-related legislation (in the case of reducing carbon emissions), would offer opportunities for reputational enhancement, including through sustainability certification (such as signing the UN Global Compact or becoming a B Corp-certified corporation) and may offer access to a growing international network of organizations similarly aligned towards creating positive societal impact through their companyâs orientation and business model.\n\nGiven the huge impact COVID-19 has had on small businesses and the ongoing fallout from Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, SMEs have found themselves in a state of simply needing to survive and other objectives have fallen by the wayside. This survivalist mindset has, for example, reduced the focus on the societal impact for SMEs. In addition, many SMEs may feel underprepared to engage in sustainable practices or believe themselves to be too small to have much impact. Whereas some SMEs have sustainability as a core- or by-product of their business model, others believe they donât have the resources (financial and/or knowledge) to make this leap and are often not sure where to begin â the challenge can feel overwhelming. However, proactively addressing sustainability through innovative products or services can serve as a way to tap into new markets and minimize the increasing regulatory risks associated with not doing so. Younger workers have also shown a growing preference for engaging with mission-led companies that focus on positive societal impact. Embracing the potential strategic advantages of positive societal impact in this way offers multiple value-creating routes as well as an opportunity to gain reputational benefits as champions of the implementation of sustainability strategies. Finally, embracing sustainability and adopting future-readiness can unlock access to capital. SMEs often face a problem with securing the capital they need and, increasingly, environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards are integral to that process. Aligning with broader social and economic development goals set by governments and investors can unlock new opportunities offered by start-up accelerators, incubators and venture capitalists. Government grants are also increasingly available for companies that help a nation or region move closer to established sustainability goals.\n\nFuture-ready SMEs will need business models that affect society positively in line with ESG goals and this requires them to place such sustainability at the centre of their business strategies, with the payoffs potentially being talent acquisition and retention, access to capital and alignment with regulatory protocols and broader sustainable development goals.\n\n_\\* Ms. Bryonie Guthrie is on the Strategic Intelligence team at the World Economic Forum in Geneva, Switzerland.

transformative power to support inclusive and sustainable socio-economic development, and the opportunity for SMEs to unlock the value-added of their products with Geographical Indications (GIs).\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG5: Gender equality Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\n\nSDG8: Decent work and economic growth Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\n\nSDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nSubject\n\nSMEs and the implementation of the SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\nwomen empowerment\n\nIn many developing countries, the agrifood industry is the largest industry. It therefore has the potential to drive future socio-economic development via an inclusive and sustainable agri-food industry. As much as it remains a developmental challenge, this sector also constitutes an opportunity for small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nConsumers are increasingly interested in traditional agrifood products that are deeply rooted in their territories of origin. This trend is a major opportunity for producers and particularly SMEs, as they need not compete with generic and standardized products. On the contrary, this trend rewards SMEs for excelling in what, in a way, they have always done: producing traditional products, whose specific quality, attributes or reputation are linked to ancestral know-how and the place where they are produced.\n\nIn the marketplace, origin-linked products can secure premium prices, provided they are clearly differentiated and identifiable to consumers. Geographical Indications (GIs), certified quality labels and origin-linked brands are tools that can help producers to unlock the value added of these type of products.\n\nThe United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) promotes industrial development to reduce poverty, and to promote sustainability and inclusive globalization. It has long implemented technical assistance projects in developing countries to foster agro-industrial value chain development: fostering business linkages, improving quality compliance, enhancing productivity, and promoting market access. UNIDO has drawn on the experiences of more than 20 countries to develop tools and methodologies for preserving and promoting origin-linked products, with the goal of driving and achieving sustainable and inclusive industrial development, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nUNIDO applies a holistic approach that broadly covers related areas of intervention to ensure that SMEs can maximize the potential of traditional agri-food products, and that benefits are fairly distributed along the value chain. UNIDO offers support to strengthen the organization and governance of agro-industrial value chains, improve the productivity and competitiveness of SMEs, in addition to fostering product diversification, innovation and the boosting of national and international market access through collective marketing activities. UNIDO also helps to ensure that products comply with the requirements of origin-linked quality labels and GIs, in order to position them in higher niche markets, allowing the producers to obtain a premium price and higher revenues.\n\nUNIDOâs approach to developing value chains around typical food products, contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in various ways. Origin-linked products have an impact towards achieving inclusive industrialization, not only through improved income opportunities, but also through the empowerment of women, job creation and the preservation of local resources and cultural heritage.\n\n**PAMPAT programme â Tunisia and Morocco**\n\nOne major initiative implemented by UNIDO to promote local products is PAMPAT (websites: [www.pampat.tn](http://www.pampat.tn)\n and [www.pampat.ma](http://www.pampat.ma)\n). Launched in 2013, the Programme for Market Access of Typical Products (PAMPAT), financed by the Swiss Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), is aimed at improving the performance, market access and socio-economic conditions of SMEs in various agri-food value chains in North-African countries. Project activities focus on strengthening the organization of selected value chains; on improving the productivity, quality compliance and product development of SMEs; and on enhancing their position in the domestic and export markets. The programme helps to ensure that products comply with the requirements of GIs and quality labels, in order to position them in niche markets and to allow the producers to obtain a premium price and higher revenues. PAMPAT also strengthens national and regional capacities in the promotion of local origin-linked food products.\n\nThe programme, since 2014 has also been supporting the setup and organization of the Moroccan, Tunisian and Egyptian Contests for Typical Food Products and is currently assisting in the preparations for the Cameroonian Contest. PAMPAT facilitates the exchanges of experience and regional best practices. As a result of these initiatives, an International Network of Organizers of Typical Food Products Contests now exists, with a [web-based platform](http://www.concours-terroir.org)\n launched in 2020 to facilitate information sharing and to capitalize on best practices. Besides Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Switzerland, other countries interested in applying the methodology and to set up a National Contest, such as Algeria, Ivory Coast and Georgia are also participating in the annual Network meeting.\n\nOver the years different value chains in Morocco and Tunisia have been receiving targeted assistance. Farmers and companies in the argan oil, cactus/ prickly pear, pomegranates, harissa, dried tomatoes, figs and processed dates sectors have benefited from the UNIDO programme.\n\nIn Morocco, UNIDO supported the argan oil value chain, focused on women, with a view to ensure the certification of producers and the market promotion of the Protected Geographical Indications (PGI). Within this project, the [Argan Oil Protected Biosphere](https://en.unesco.org/biosphere/arab-states/arganeraie)\n has been one of the focus value chains, with a specific emphasis on how to ensure women integration in the global value chain, preservation of natural resources and development of an inclusive and sustainable local industry, leaving no one behind.\n\nIn this respect, the Interprofessional Argan Federation (FIFARGANE) was assisted to develop a traceability software to ensure that producers respect the code of practice for the production of the argan oil under the approved code of practice for the PGI. Producers, including women cooperatives, groups of women cooperatives and SMEs, were trained to comply with the same code of practice, as well as with the national law on food safety and hygiene. As a result, the number of producers certified based on the PGI increased by 150% between 2013 and 2019. The programme also covered the promotion of collective branding centered on the argan oil PGI in order to enhance market access for argan oil products produced by SME cooperatives and consortia, mainly women-owned.\n\nSimilarly, in Tunisia, the PGI labeling approach was applied to the local fig value chain in the village of Djebba. This rural area is located in the North-West of the country. Thanks to the unique quality attributes of the Djebba fig, it became the first fruit in Tunisia to be granted a Protected Geographical Indication. The programme supported producers in Djebba to comply with the product specifications of the PGI and also worked with local authorities to establish a local association in charge by law of the self-control system. In 2019, 25% of the local production was certified with the PGI.\n\nTo convey the quality attributes of the labelled PGI figs to the consumers, a public-private promotion programme was set up, consisting of tasting events in Tunisian supermarket chains, cooking events and participation in trade fairs. As a result of the intervention, prices for the fig producers in Djebba doubled and the PGI fruits were sold in different retail chains all over Tunisia, and were also exported to the Gulf countries and Canada.\n\nIn order to create additional revenues for the people of Djebba, the programme also supported local women producer groups to start offering and marketing local products such as sun-dried figs, jams, traditional pastries and essential oils. A cooperative and two rural women groups were established and assisted to set-up new production facilities that comply with the legal requirements. Furthermore, they received trainings and technical assistance to standardize new processing techniques, to create innovative packaging and logistics solutions and to incorporate modern marketing and sales techniques. These new products from Djebba experienced a notable success in the local market. Within a couple of years, prices of dried figs had increased by 50%. The PGI Djebba fig has also played a core role in making the mountain village increasingly well-known among Tunisians. Between 2015 and 2019 the number of visitors had more than doubled ([www.aoc-figuedjebba.com](http://www.aoc-figuedjebba.com)\n).\n\nThe programme is also supporting the development of the prickly pear/ cactus value chain in Tunisia. Although the country is ranked 5th in the world in terms of cultivated land, until recently this agricultural sector was generating little income, since hundreds of small-scale farmers were focused in low-value produce for livestock feeding. Indeed in Tunisia the prickly pear has always been considered the fruit of the poor. When the UNIDO programme started in 2013 there were only five agroindustrial companies in the whole country, which were specialized in the production of the high-priced cosmetic cactus seed oil.\n\nIn order to develop this value chain, UNIDO in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture initiated a training programme for young entrepreneurs to support them in the setting up their businesses and to obtain the necessary organic certification. There are now 55 companies in the cactus value chain that are currently being supported by PAMPAT. These new businesses have been responsible for the creation of around 1,200 permanent and seasonal jobs (2016-2021). Women play a prominent role in the value chain. Almost half of the new start-ups are managed by women and the biggest part of the agricultural and industrial workforce are women.\n\nPAMPAT has also supported the increasing number of start-ups to group together, to create a national cactus development association and to promote a newly created collective brand for organic Tunisian cactus seed oil at national and international trade fairs ([www.anadectunisie.com](http://www.anadectunisie.com)\n). Over 30 companies are currently exporting now compared to 4 in 2013. Despite the global economic crisis linked to the pandemic, exports have increased by 50% between 2019 and 2021. Europe remains the primary target market, although exports cover all the 5 continents.\n\nOver the last years, the sector has experienced a great diversification of its product range. At the very beginning, the value chain focused almost exclusively on bulk production of organic prickly pear seed oil. Today, companies also offer other cosmetic products made of cactus as well as a wide range of agrofood products and food supplements with more added value.\n\nEntrepreneurship development in the cosmetics and agrofood sector has also had a positive impact on the demand for certified organic agricultural produce. Tunisia is ranked first in the world when it comes to certified organic production of prickly pears according to the [_Agence franÃ§aise pour le DÃ©veloppement et la Promotion de lâAgriculture Biologique_](https://www.agencebio.org/)\n. Farmers receive higher prices for their organic certified supplies and thanks to the increase in industrial demand, farmers can now sell out-graded fruits that could not be sold in consumer fresh markets. The companiesâ increasing demand for cactus produce, has increased the bargaining power of rural female cactus workers in the production hub Kasserine (west-central of Tunisia), who have seen their salaries rise by 50%.\n\nToday the prickly pear/cactus value chain is considered as a growing economic sector that creates significant value-added and attracts increased support from public and private institutions. Thanks to the increased visibility of the prickly pear/cactus value chain, Tunisian authorities have published, in 2021, the first technical standard for cosmetic prickly pear seed oil with UNIDOâs support. Tunisia has become the first country in the world to standardize the characteristics of this oil. This new standard will further boost Tunisian cactus oil exports. The next objective of the cactus producers is to register a PGI for the prickly pear from the region of Kasserine with UNIDOâs support in order to position what was once considered the fruit of the poor on selected niche markets.\n\n_\\* Ebe Muschialli joined UNIDO in 2013 starting as a cluster and network expert based in the UNIDO Representative in Rabat.

These new products from Djebba experienced a notable success in the local market. Within a couple of years, prices of dried figs had increased by 50%. The PGI Djebba fig has also played a core role in making the mountain village increasingly well-known among Tunisians. Between 2015 and 2019 the number of visitors had more than doubled ([www.aoc-figuedjebba.com](http://www.aoc-figuedjebba.com)\n).\n\nThe programme is also supporting the development of the prickly pear/ cactus value chain in Tunisia. Although the country is ranked 5th in the world in terms of cultivated land, until recently this agricultural sector was generating little income, since hundreds of small-scale farmers were focused in low-value produce for livestock feeding. Indeed in Tunisia the prickly pear has always been considered the fruit of the poor. When the UNIDO programme started in 2013 there were only five agroindustrial companies in the whole country, which were specialized in the production of the high-priced cosmetic cactus seed oil.\n\nIn order to develop this value chain, UNIDO in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture initiated a training programme for young entrepreneurs to support them in the setting up their businesses and to obtain the necessary organic certification. There are now 55 companies in the cactus value chain that are currently being supported by PAMPAT. These new businesses have been responsible for the creation of around 1,200 permanent and seasonal jobs (2016-2021). Women play a prominent role in the value chain. Almost half of the new start-ups are managed by women and the biggest part of the agricultural and industrial workforce are women.\n\nPAMPAT has also supported the increasing number of start-ups to group together, to create a national cactus development association and to promote a newly created collective brand for organic Tunisian cactus seed oil at national and international trade fairs ([www.anadectunisie.com](http://www.anadectunisie.com)\n). Over 30 companies are currently exporting now compared to 4 in 2013. Despite the global economic crisis linked to the pandemic, exports have increased by 50% between 2019 and 2021. Europe remains the primary target market, although exports cover all the 5 continents.\n\nOver the last years, the sector has experienced a great diversification of its product range. At the very beginning, the value chain focused almost exclusively on bulk production of organic prickly pear seed oil. Today, companies also offer other cosmetic products made of cactus as well as a wide range of agrofood products and food supplements with more added value.\n\nEntrepreneurship development in the cosmetics and agrofood sector has also had a positive impact on the demand for certified organic agricultural produce. Tunisia is ranked first in the world when it comes to certified organic production of prickly pears according to the [_Agence franÃ§aise pour le DÃ©veloppement et la Promotion de lâAgriculture Biologique_](https://www.agencebio.org/)\n. Farmers receive higher prices for their organic certified supplies and thanks to the increase in industrial demand, farmers can now sell out-graded fruits that could not be sold in consumer fresh markets. The companiesâ increasing demand for cactus produce, has increased the bargaining power of rural female cactus workers in the production hub Kasserine (west-central of Tunisia), who have seen their salaries rise by 50%.\n\nToday the prickly pear/cactus value chain is considered as a growing economic sector that creates significant value-added and attracts increased support from public and private institutions. Thanks to the increased visibility of the prickly pear/cactus value chain, Tunisian authorities have published, in 2021, the first technical standard for cosmetic prickly pear seed oil with UNIDOâs support. Tunisia has become the first country in the world to standardize the characteristics of this oil. This new standard will further boost Tunisian cactus oil exports. The next objective of the cactus producers is to register a PGI for the prickly pear from the region of Kasserine with UNIDOâs support in order to position what was once considered the fruit of the poor on selected niche markets.\n\n_\\* Ebe Muschialli joined UNIDO in 2013 starting as a cluster and network expert based in the UNIDO Representative in Rabat.

entrepreneurs as key agents in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs. It discusses the challenges of women-led businesses, global trends and proposes suggestions for overcoming these challenges and strengthening women-led entrepreneurship.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG5: Gender equality Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\n\nSDG8: Decent work and economic growth Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\n\nSDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nSubject\n\nSMEs and the implementation of the SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\nentrepreneurship\n\nSMEs\n\nsustainable development\n\nwomen\n\nWomen entrepreneurs are active agents of change to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Despite recent progress in strengthening womenâs entrepreneurship, significant differences in the number of women and men as owners and managers of microenterprises and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) persist. The broad field of research and existing lessons learned can shape present and future approaches to level the playing field for women-owned enterprises.\n\n> **Strengthening women entrepreneurs is a human right, and an economic and environmental imperative**\n\nGender disparities in entrepreneurship stem from deeply enshrined legal, socioeconomic and cultural discriminatory gender norms and practices. Men and boys as well as women and girls continue to be influenced by these gender inequalities that permeate all aspects of their daily lives. They also have a direct effect on womenâs business activities: The higher the level of gender equality in law in a country, the higher its share of women entrepreneurs. The same applies to the number of years of education of women, their access to bank accounts and their ability to take loans from a financial institution, which all have a positive impact on womenâs entrepreneurship.[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1)\n\nDiminishing the gender pay gap and strengthening womenâs businesses makes economic sense. Because of differences in lifetime earnings between women and men, countries are currently losing $172 trillion in wealth. Conversely, if women were earning as much as men, human capital wealth could increase by about one fifth globally.[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2)\n Also, a wide array of studies highlight the benefits of gender equality and diversity for the profitability and level of innovation of businesses.[\\[3\\]](#_ftn3)\n As the figure below illustrates, once women-led start-ups and MSMEs dispose of enough financial means, their return on investment exceeds the average.[\\[4\\]](#_ftn4)\n\n_Figure 1: Return of investments of start-ups founded or cofounded by women_\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Figure-1-Blog-3-S2.jpg)\n\nSource: Boston Consulting Group (2018). [Why Women-Owned Startups Are a Better Bet](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet)\n.\n\nInvesting in women entrepreneurs is also smart for achieving social and environmental objectives. To successfully counter the climate crisis, we need to fully tap into all human potential â including that of women. Studies further suggest that women entrepreneurs show higher levels of social and environmental orientation than their male counterparts.[\\[5\\]](#_ftn5)\n They were also found to be more likely than men to emphasize social goals over economic goals and to engage in ecological venturing.[\\[6\\]](#_ftn6)\n In fact, across the globe, the gender gap in social entrepreneurship is significantly smaller than that in mainstream entrepreneurship, and women-led social ventures perform at least equally compared to those led by men.[\\[7\\]](#_ftn7)\n This is in line with findings that women entrepreneurs, more often than men, focus their field of operation towards community needs or social needs.[\\[8\\]](#_ftn8)\n\n> **Women-owned businesses still face specific challenges in entrepreneurship, with negative effects on firm size and profit**\n\nHowever, owning and managing a business remains a male-dominated territory. Globally, only less than one in five businesses have a woman as their top manager, only one in three businesses have a woman among their principal owners, and women are the sole or majority owners of less than 15% of businesses.[\\[9\\]](#_ftn9)\n\n_Figure 2: Percentage of firms with majority female ownership_\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Figure-2-Blog-3-S2-1536x922.jpg)\n\nSource: UNIDO elaboration based on data from [World Bank Enterprise Surveys](https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/data/exploretopics/gender)\n.\n\nAlso, the larger the business, the lower the share of women-owned businesses. For example, in limited liability companies â a legal form largely used for SMEs[\\[10\\]](#_ftn10)\n â the share of female business owners only ranges from 2% to 39%,[\\[11\\]](#_ftn11)\n while for microenterprises with a maximum of 10 employees, the share of businesses with women as sole proprietors is significantly higher, ranging from 3% to 47% and only in two countries, women hold the majority of microenterprises.[\\[12\\]](#_ftn12)\n\nMoreover, women-led MSMEs also dispose of less capital than businesses owned by men: Only 28% of MSMEs are owned by women, but they account for 32% of the MSME finance gap. This gender finance gap is especially pronounced in developing economies. Importantly, it also widens with the size of the business and is thus larger at the SME level than for microenterprises.[\\[13\\]](#_ftn13)\n\nFor start-ups, the situation is similar. Women-led start-ups also receive significantly less funding than their male counterparts: Globally, only 7% of venture capital is invested in women-led businesses.[\\[14\\]](#_ftn14)\n This disparity is neither justified by differences in the foundersâ profiles such as the level of education, nor by differences in profits.\n\n> **SUGGESTION 1: Instead of focusing on high-growth firms, rather support women-owned SMEs in growth-oriented sectors**\n\nThe significant gender differences in firm size and access to finance are both a cause for and a result of the varying representation of women across economic sectors, including industry. The more profitable a sector and the higher its average wages and profits, the fewer women business owners, managers and decision-makers can be found.[\\[15\\]](#_ftn15)\n As illustrated in the figure below, women entrepreneurs (and also women employees) are less likely to operate in growth-oriented and technology-intensive sectors such as computer, electronics, machinery and transport equipment. It is also no coincidence that these ânonâfeminineâ industries are the fastest-growing sectors with high investments and high return on investment. At the same time, women entrepreneurs are overrepresented in low-technology industrial sectors with lower profit margins such as the food, garment, textile and leather sectors, but also in service and retail.[\\[16\\]](#_ftn16)\n\n_Figure 3: Â _Structure of female employment in manufacturing sectors by technology intensity__\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/fig_6a_emp_tech_F-1024x1024.png)\n\nSource: UNIDO elaboration based on ILO Employment by sex and economic activity â ISIC level 2 and ILO Modelled Estimates â November 2021. Accessed December 2021.\n\nThe fact that women-led MSMEs tend to be smaller, less profitable and grow slower than male-led firms is directly related to these sectoral disparities.[\\[17\\]](#_ftn17)\n For example, a long-term study of U.S.-based entrepreneurs shows that womenâowned firms in so-called âfeminineâ industries are less likely to achieve high growth than womenâowned firms in ânon-feminineâ industries.[\\[18\\]](#_ftn18)\n\nTherefore, much speaks for strengthening measures to support market entry and business growth of women entrepreneurs into these high-growth sectors with a traditionally low representation of women. Supporting womenâs networks and role models has been identified as an important factor that should be prioritized in this regard.[\\[19\\]](#_ftn19)\n For example, a study in Ethiopia showed that these factors are a key determinant for a womanâs decision in which sector to establish her business.[\\[20\\]](#_ftn20)\n\nThis approach also seems to be preferable to supporting already existing high-growth firms owned or led by women. In fact, high-growth firms have received significant attention in the last years. Making up less than one fifth of all firms in the manufacturing and service sectors while creating more than half of all new jobs and sales in high-income and developing countries alike, they indeed play an important role in strengthening economic productivity and creating ripple effects.[\\[21\\]](#_ftn21)\n However, women-owned/-led high-growth firms are rare. For example, in the U.S., close to 40% of high-growth firms donât even have one single woman on their boards.[\\[22\\]](#_ftn22)\n Also, studies show that high-growth rather seems to be a finite phase than a long-term firm characteristic, and that high-growth does not necessarily translate into high productivity.[\\[23\\]](#_ftn23)\n\n> **SUGGESTION 2: When supporting women-owned SMEs, a holistic, multi-level approach is desirable**\n\nIn light of the multiple and intersecting forms of gender inequality, a one-dimensional approach, even if applied in crucial areas such as women entrepreneursâ access to finance (e.g. through cash transfers, grants or facilitating affordable loans) often lacks effectiveness and sustainability. Instead, aggregating efforts, bundling services and an ecosystems approach is paramount.[\\[24\\]](#_ftn24)\n As gender disparities affect individual, institutional and normative spheres alike, direct support to women-owned SMEs should be coupled with strengthening womenâs business associations and other civil society organizations, and providing advice to the public sector in the development and implementation of policies that foster womenâs entrepreneurship. Efficient support to women entrepreneurs therefore also entails the need to forge multi-level partnerships â from financial institutions to business representations to regulatory and policymaking bodies.[\\[25\\]](#_ftn25)\n\nThe [evaluation findings](https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/files/2017-11/RAB-140026_EvalReport_WomenEmpowmt.pdf)\n of a [UNIDO project to promote women entrepreneurs and women-led SMEs in the MENA Region](https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/files/2019-03/UNIDO_Women_Empowerment_MENA_Factsheet_EN.pdf)\n exemplify this by highlighting the projectâs holistic, multi-level approach as good practice, which has also been further intensified in the currently ongoing [second phase of the project](https://open.unido.org/projects/C6/projects/170136)\n. This strategy combined facilitating gender-responsive policy reforms with capacity development of intermediate institutions such as women business associations, and providing targeted support to women entrepreneurs in three main areas: capacity building on business development and management, strengthening access to networks and market platforms, and providing financial support.\n\nIn practice, however, limited resources often affect the scope of support to strengthening women entrepreneurs. Sometimes, stakeholders are faced with the need to choose between focusing on one set of measures applied across several sectors and subsectors, or providing a broad range of measures within one value chain. From the aforementioned research and evaluation findings that highlight the good practice of providing holistic support, it can be deduced that of the two options, providing a broad range of measures within one value chain would be the preferable one.\n\n> **SUGGESTION 3: In countering the climate crisis, strengthening women-owned SMEs is both the right and the smart thing to do**\n\nEfforts to make gender equality in entrepreneurship a lived reality must be guided by countering climate change â the most important global systemic threat for the global economy.[\\[26\\]](#_ftn26)\n The message of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâs (IPCC) most recent sixth assessment report, is clear: Some impacts of the climate crisis are already irreversible, even if global warming will be reduced in the future. Global efforts to counter climate change need to urgently and significantly increase to avoid further permanent harm.[\\[27\\]](#_ftn27)\n\nThe link between female entrepreneurship and fostering more inclusive, green and smart growth has often been underappreciated. In fact, women seem to be more attracted to green industries than to traditional ones. For example, the share of women in the renewable energy sector workforce is higher than that in the fossil fuel sector, notably 32% compared to 22%.[\\[28\\]](#_ftn28)\n Also, [UNIDO research](https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/files/2021-06/Synthesis_Report_Final.pdf)\n suggests that women entrepreneurs are more inclined to set up and expand their businesses in green industries than in conventional industries.[\\[29\\]](#_ftn29)\n\nPriority should also be given to initiatives that support women entrepreneurs with a promising business approach that contributes to achieving climate goals. As detailed in the figure below, energy, industry, forestry, transportation and agriculture are the sectors with the highest potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with much of this potential being at the supply side. For the industrial sector, reaching net-zero CO2 emissions by 2030 requires bold and concerted actions across all mitigation options, including energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, and transformational changes in production processes.[\\[30\\]](#_ftn30)\n\n_Figure 4: Potential contribution to net emission reduction by sector_\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Figure-4-Blog-3-S2-png.jpg)\n\n_Source_: IPCC (2022). Working Group III contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nMoreover, the shift to energy sustainability and circular economy is estimated to generate a gross amount of over 100 million jobs and a net amount of 20 million jobs by 2030, but the majority of these new jobs will be created in male-dominated sectors.[\\[31\\]](#_ftn31)\n Hence, in order for women to equally benefit from the shift to green economies and industries, specific measures to reduce gender inequalities and empower women in these sectors and industries are needed.\n\nWomen-owned MSMEs constitute a huge potential for innovation, growth, and reducing the impact of climate change and environmental degradation. To advance progress towards net-zero, climate-neutral and green industries and economies, we therefore need to fully tap into womenâs abilities as entrepreneurs, managers and innovators.\n\n_\\* Cecilia Ugaz Estrada is Director of Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women Office and Special Advisor, Office of the Managing Director, Directorate of Corporate Management and Operations, UNIDO.

entrepreneurs as key agents in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and SDGs. It discusses the challenges of women-led businesses, global trends and proposes suggestions for overcoming these challenges and strengthening women-led entrepreneurship.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG5: Gender equality Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\n\nSDG8: Decent work and economic growth Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\n\nSDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nSubject\n\nSMEs and the implementation of the SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\nentrepreneurship\n\nSMEs\n\nsustainable development\n\nwomen\n\nWomen entrepreneurs are active agents of change to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Despite recent progress in strengthening womenâs entrepreneurship, significant differences in the number of women and men as owners and managers of microenterprises and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) persist. The broad field of research and existing lessons learned can shape present and future approaches to level the playing field for women-owned enterprises.\n\n> **Strengthening women entrepreneurs is a human right, and an economic and environmental imperative**\n\nGender disparities in entrepreneurship stem from deeply enshrined legal, socioeconomic and cultural discriminatory gender norms and practices. Men and boys as well as women and girls continue to be influenced by these gender inequalities that permeate all aspects of their daily lives. They also have a direct effect on womenâs business activities: The higher the level of gender equality in law in a country, the higher its share of women entrepreneurs. The same applies to the number of years of education of women, their access to bank accounts and their ability to take loans from a financial institution, which all have a positive impact on womenâs entrepreneurship.[\\[1\\]](#_ftn1)\n\nDiminishing the gender pay gap and strengthening womenâs businesses makes economic sense. Because of differences in lifetime earnings between women and men, countries are currently losing $172 trillion in wealth. Conversely, if women were earning as much as men, human capital wealth could increase by about one fifth globally.[\\[2\\]](#_ftn2)\n Also, a wide array of studies highlight the benefits of gender equality and diversity for the profitability and level of innovation of businesses.[\\[3\\]](#_ftn3)\n As the figure below illustrates, once women-led start-ups and MSMEs dispose of enough financial means, their return on investment exceeds the average.[\\[4\\]](#_ftn4)\n\n_Figure 1: Return of investments of start-ups founded or cofounded by women_\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Figure-1-Blog-3-S2.jpg)\n\nSource: Boston Consulting Group (2018). [Why Women-Owned Startups Are a Better Bet](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2018/why-women-owned-startups-are-better-bet)\n.\n\nInvesting in women entrepreneurs is also smart for achieving social and environmental objectives. To successfully counter the climate crisis, we need to fully tap into all human potential â including that of women. Studies further suggest that women entrepreneurs show higher levels of social and environmental orientation than their male counterparts.[\\[5\\]](#_ftn5)\n They were also found to be more likely than men to emphasize social goals over economic goals and to engage in ecological venturing.[\\[6\\]](#_ftn6)\n In fact, across the globe, the gender gap in social entrepreneurship is significantly smaller than that in mainstream entrepreneurship, and women-led social ventures perform at least equally compared to those led by men.[\\[7\\]](#_ftn7)\n This is in line with findings that women entrepreneurs, more often than men, focus their field of operation towards community needs or social needs.[\\[8\\]](#_ftn8)\n\n> **Women-owned businesses still face specific challenges in entrepreneurship, with negative effects on firm size and profit**\n\nHowever, owning and managing a business remains a male-dominated territory. Globally, only less than one in five businesses have a woman as their top manager, only one in three businesses have a woman among their principal owners, and women are the sole or majority owners of less than 15% of businesses.[\\[9\\]](#_ftn9)\n\n_Figure 2: Percentage of firms with majority female ownership_\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Figure-2-Blog-3-S2-1536x922.jpg)\n\nSource: UNIDO elaboration based on data from [World Bank Enterprise Surveys](https://www.enterprisesurveys.org/en/data/exploretopics/gender)\n.\n\nAlso, the larger the business, the lower the share of women-owned businesses. For example, in limited liability companies â a legal form largely used for SMEs[\\[10\\]](#_ftn10)\n â the share of female business owners only ranges from 2% to 39%,[\\[11\\]](#_ftn11)\n while for microenterprises with a maximum of 10 employees, the share of businesses with women as sole proprietors is significantly higher, ranging from 3% to 47% and only in two countries, women hold the majority of microenterprises.[\\[12\\]](#_ftn12)\n\nMoreover, women-led MSMEs also dispose of less capital than businesses owned by men: Only 28% of MSMEs are owned by women, but they account for 32% of the MSME finance gap. This gender finance gap is especially pronounced in developing economies. Importantly, it also widens with the size of the business and is thus larger at the SME level than for microenterprises.[\\[13\\]](#_ftn13)\n\nFor start-ups, the situation is similar. Women-led start-ups also receive significantly less funding than their male counterparts: Globally, only 7% of venture capital is invested in women-led businesses.[\\[14\\]](#_ftn14)\n This disparity is neither justified by differences in the foundersâ profiles such as the level of education, nor by differences in profits.\n\n> **SUGGESTION 1: Instead of focusing on high-growth firms, rather support women-owned SMEs in growth-oriented sectors**\n\nThe significant gender differences in firm size and access to finance are both a cause for and a result of the varying representation of women across economic sectors, including industry. The more profitable a sector and the higher its average wages and profits, the fewer women business owners, managers and decision-makers can be found.[\\[15\\]](#_ftn15)\n As illustrated in the figure below, women entrepreneurs (and also women employees) are less likely to operate in growth-oriented and technology-intensive sectors such as computer, electronics, machinery and transport equipment. It is also no coincidence that these ânonâfeminineâ industries are the fastest-growing sectors with high investments and high return on investment. At the same time, women entrepreneurs are overrepresented in low-technology industrial sectors with lower profit margins such as the food, garment, textile and leather sectors, but also in service and retail.[\\[16\\]](#_ftn16)\n\n_Figure 3: Â _Structure of female employment in manufacturing sectors by technology intensity__\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/fig_6a_emp_tech_F-1024x1024.png)\n\nSource: UNIDO elaboration based on ILO Employment by sex and economic activity â ISIC level 2 and ILO Modelled Estimates â November 2021. Accessed December 2021.\n\nThe fact that women-led MSMEs tend to be smaller, less profitable and grow slower than male-led firms is directly related to these sectoral disparities.[\\[17\\]](#_ftn17)\n For example, a long-term study of U.S.-based entrepreneurs shows that womenâowned firms in so-called âfeminineâ industries are less likely to achieve high growth than womenâowned firms in ânon-feminineâ industries.[\\[18\\]](#_ftn18)\n\nTherefore, much speaks for strengthening measures to support market entry and business growth of women entrepreneurs into these high-growth sectors with a traditionally low representation of women. Supporting womenâs networks and role models has been identified as an important factor that should be prioritized in this regard.[\\[19\\]](#_ftn19)\n For example, a study in Ethiopia showed that these factors are a key determinant for a womanâs decision in which sector to establish her business.[\\[20\\]](#_ftn20)\n\nThis approach also seems to be preferable to supporting already existing high-growth firms owned or led by women. In fact, high-growth firms have received significant attention in the last years. Making up less than one fifth of all firms in the manufacturing and service sectors while creating more than half of all new jobs and sales in high-income and developing countries alike, they indeed play an important role in strengthening economic productivity and creating ripple effects.[\\[21\\]](#_ftn21)\n However, women-owned/-led high-growth firms are rare. For example, in the U.S., close to 40% of high-growth firms donât even have one single woman on their boards.[\\[22\\]](#_ftn22)\n Also, studies show that high-growth rather seems to be a finite phase than a long-term firm characteristic, and that high-growth does not necessarily translate into high productivity.[\\[23\\]](#_ftn23)\n\n> **SUGGESTION 2: When supporting women-owned SMEs, a holistic, multi-level approach is desirable**\n\nIn light of the multiple and intersecting forms of gender inequality, a one-dimensional approach, even if applied in crucial areas such as women entrepreneursâ access to finance (e.g. through cash transfers, grants or facilitating affordable loans) often lacks effectiveness and sustainability. Instead, aggregating efforts, bundling services and an ecosystems approach is paramount.[\\[24\\]](#_ftn24)\n As gender disparities affect individual, institutional and normative spheres alike, direct support to women-owned SMEs should be coupled with strengthening womenâs business associations and other civil society organizations, and providing advice to the public sector in the development and implementation of policies that foster womenâs entrepreneurship. Efficient support to women entrepreneurs therefore also entails the need to forge multi-level partnerships â from financial institutions to business representations to regulatory and policymaking bodies.[\\[25\\]](#_ftn25)\n\nThe [evaluation findings](https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/files/2017-11/RAB-140026_EvalReport_WomenEmpowmt.pdf)\n of a [UNIDO project to promote women entrepreneurs and women-led SMEs in the MENA Region](https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/files/2019-03/UNIDO_Women_Empowerment_MENA_Factsheet_EN.pdf)\n exemplify this by highlighting the projectâs holistic, multi-level approach as good practice, which has also been further intensified in the currently ongoing [second phase of the project](https://open.unido.org/projects/C6/projects/170136)\n. This strategy combined facilitating gender-responsive policy reforms with capacity development of intermediate institutions such as women business associations, and providing targeted support to women entrepreneurs in three main areas: capacity building on business development and management, strengthening access to networks and market platforms, and providing financial support.\n\nIn practice, however, limited resources often affect the scope of support to strengthening women entrepreneurs. Sometimes, stakeholders are faced with the need to choose between focusing on one set of measures applied across several sectors and subsectors, or providing a broad range of measures within one value chain. From the aforementioned research and evaluation findings that highlight the good practice of providing holistic support, it can be deduced that of the two options, providing a broad range of measures within one value chain would be the preferable one.\n\n> **SUGGESTION 3: In countering the climate crisis, strengthening women-owned SMEs is both the right and the smart thing to do**\n\nEfforts to make gender equality in entrepreneurship a lived reality must be guided by countering climate change â the most important global systemic threat for the global economy.[\\[26\\]](#_ftn26)\n The message of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeâs (IPCC) most recent sixth assessment report, is clear: Some impacts of the climate crisis are already irreversible, even if global warming will be reduced in the future. Global efforts to counter climate change need to urgently and significantly increase to avoid further permanent harm.[\\[27\\]](#_ftn27)\n\nThe link between female entrepreneurship and fostering more inclusive, green and smart growth has often been underappreciated. In fact, women seem to be more attracted to green industries than to traditional ones. For example, the share of women in the renewable energy sector workforce is higher than that in the fossil fuel sector, notably 32% compared to 22%.[\\[28\\]](#_ftn28)\n Also, [UNIDO research](https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/files/2021-06/Synthesis_Report_Final.pdf)\n suggests that women entrepreneurs are more inclined to set up and expand their businesses in green industries than in conventional industries.[\\[29\\]](#_ftn29)\n\nPriority should also be given to initiatives that support women entrepreneurs with a promising business approach that contributes to achieving climate goals. As detailed in the figure below, energy, industry, forestry, transportation and agriculture are the sectors with the highest potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with much of this potential being at the supply side. For the industrial sector, reaching net-zero CO2 emissions by 2030 requires bold and concerted actions across all mitigation options, including energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, and transformational changes in production processes.[\\[30\\]](#_ftn30)\n\n_Figure 4: Potential contribution to net emission reduction by sector_\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Figure-4-Blog-3-S2-png.jpg)\n\n_Source_: IPCC (2022). Working Group III contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nMoreover, the shift to energy sustainability and circular economy is estimated to generate a gross amount of over 100 million jobs and a net amount of 20 million jobs by 2030, but the majority of these new jobs will be created in male-dominated sectors.[\\[31\\]](#_ftn31)\n Hence, in order for women to equally benefit from the shift to green economies and industries, specific measures to reduce gender inequalities and empower women in these sectors and industries are needed.\n\nWomen-owned MSMEs constitute a huge potential for innovation, growth, and reducing the impact of climate change and environmental degradation. To advance progress towards net-zero, climate-neutral and green industries and economies, we therefore need to fully tap into womenâs abilities as entrepreneurs, managers and innovators.\n\n_\\* Cecilia Ugaz Estrada is Director of Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women Office and Special Advisor, Office of the Managing Director, Directorate of Corporate Management and Operations, UNIDO.

provides an overview of UNIDO technical assistance projects and tools targeting SMEs and their clusters active in the creative industry. It explores how digitalization-based business management practices, industrial design, branding are strategically linked to local cultural heritage.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG8: Decent work and economic growth Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\n\nSDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nSubject\n\nSMEs and the implementation of the SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\ncreative industries\n\ndigitalization\n\ninnovation\n\nSMEs\n\nsustainability\n\nIn the context of post-pandemic recovery, the global outlook is still one of a protracted economic downturn with knock-on effects on efforts towards sustainable growth and transformational changes through technological innovation across industries. It is highly important to be mindful of the signs emerging from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the informal sector, as they continue to play an increasingly essential role in both job creation and the well-being of people at large. This is especially true for developing countries and countries with economies in transition, where SMEs make up the majority of industries and have been far less successful in coping with the pandemic-related slump that brought large parts of industrial production to a standstill in early 2020. Looking back to the times preceding the pandemic, their development potential was often untapped due to a number of challenges ranging from limited access to financial and government support measures to a lack of expertise in adopting dynamic development strategies in order to maintain business continuity amid a crisis. In [creative industries](https://youtu.be/IvSqMntqosQ)\n (CIs), COVID-19 has affected SMEs in a myriad of ways, literally making them the first to shut their doors. Evidence on the pandemic-related economic fallout suggests that SMEs active in CIs are also at risk, ending up among the last to fully return back on track, as they struggle to remain afloat amid shrinking customer demand, disrupted supply chains, and partial or total shutdown of related economic sectors, such as tourism. This expertise and cultural heritage are contributing to social change, and to improved livelihoods of vulnerable social groups and rural communities, including [youth, women and refugees, through new employment and entrepreneurial opportunities](https://youtu.be/LQtDrlM-8xI)\n.\n\nAlthough the crisis is still largely ongoing throughout the world, efforts are underway to address the emerging challenges. In CIs, a large portion of development and recovery solutions are becoming increasingly associated with digitalization. Offering new windows of opportunities to nurture creativity and preserve traditions, the digital realm holds significant potential, in terms of accelerating the shift to more innovative and intangibles-oriented practices, such as [industrial design, online marketing and strategic branding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5U5nB5jtSc)\n that can successfully draw upon the local origin of products, tradition and national heritage. Characterized by intense competition, digitalization also encourages the production of higher-quality goods and services that meet market demands. It can thus help improve many economic and social outcomes, and be a force to address development issues, including those related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, UNIDO incorporates the perspective of country-, region- and enterprise-level economic actors that are willing to reinvent their modus operandi toÂ reap the benefits offered by the digitalization era. As the need to reconcile digitalization with economic recovery comes to the forefront, UNIDO continues to expand its technical cooperation toolkit and technical assistance portfolio, while maintaining a high level of flexibility and being mindful of both emerging macroeconomic trends and the needs of its national counterparts. UNIDO has pioneered industrial design and branding among its other impactful approaches to promote and accelerate sustainable and inclusive industrial development. We have success stories in traditional and heritage-based industries, light industries and the handicraft sector where SMEs have been able to improve the quality of their products, achieve higher productivity, diversify, attract investments, contributing to improved linkages with the tourism sector.\n\nBranding draws out the transformative value of intangible assets to the forefront and is a practical solution for enterprises to transit to a more robust and competitive digital representation. The branding approach constitutes a shift away from classic growth and crisis mitigation paradigms, opening the path to unleashing innovation, creativity and distinctiveness. In other words, urging beneficiary SMEs to explore recovery solutions that are based on the local identity represents a unique competitive advantage for the country and its creative industries. UNIDOâs project implementation experience shows that branding and industrial design do give a product an identity that distinguishes it from others in the market, reinforces business resilience, and contributes to the closing of the digital divide. UNIDO supports SMEs, helping them to grasp the importance of digital solutions and reinforce their ability to build a solid customer loyalty base. By embracing this digital transformation, enterprises can stay a step ahead of their competition and lay some very important groundwork for dealing with external pressures, owing to greater market potential and more direct access to customers through a strategically planned online presence.\n\n**UNIDO success stories in Tajikistan and Armenia: Â Blending tradition and national heritage with innovative modernityÂ for high-performing home textiles and fashion brands**\n\nAmidst the pandemic, UNIDO project beneficiaries in Armenia and Tajikistan found themselves to be well-equipped to instantly adopt digital know-how, seizing online opportunities by reorienting their sales promotion activities to social media marketing tools, e-commerce and online B2B platforms. This move allowed our beneficiaries to maintain business continuity by receiving production orders and acquiring new contracts with new partners both domestically and abroad. âLAâAL Textilesâ and â5900BCâ are two unique umbrella brands established and nurtured with UNIDO technical assistance.\n\nSince 2014, UNIDO has been supporting Armenia in the revitalization of its garment industry by strengthening the technical and managerial capacities of Armenian light industry manufacturers.\n\nArmenian textile and leather manufacturers united under the â5900BCâ brand increased their technical and production potential leading to numerous fashion collections with improved design and quality that opened access to international markets. As a result of our support, a pool of experts well-versed in the fashion industry and its modern trends was created to provide regular consultations on key topics to support the generation of additional value-added.\n\nThe Armenian textile and garment industry learned how to use digital technologies and maintain business continuity when conventional marketing channels become limited or unavailable. Based on the lessons learned during the pandemic, the support from UNIDO ensured that beneficiaries operating under the â5900BCâ brand strengthen their positions in local and international markets by efficiently using the relevant digital business tools, minimizing the impact of crises-related constraints through the adoption of new market outreach vision underpinned by a strong brand identity with high-recognition value and trust from its customers.\n\nSince 2016, UNIDO focuses on industrial upgrading and the modernization of carpet-weaving, embroidery and traditional textile sectors in Tajikistan. As a result of our interventions, textiles and home deco umbrella brand âLAâAL Textilesâ was created bringing together 9 project beneficiaries that specialize in the production of home textiles, hand-woven and machine-woven carpets. Over 6 years, having inherited a blend of well-preserved traditions in carpet-weaving and embroidery with modern home decor trends the âLAâAL Textilesâ, showcased its brand and collection at numerous national and international exhibitions, winning customersâ hearts in Tajikistan and beyond. In 2019 and 2020, the endeavour further expanded to cover a wider geographical area. Additional 11 beneficiary enterprises joined the project and embarked on upgrading their business, improving their production cycle, increasing their competitiveness and enhancing product quality to eventually, gain access to markets, building on the support of national technical expertise.\n\nFurther digital transformation has since taken place, expanding the brandâs online alternative marketing and business performance optimization solutions. Beneficiaries launched the âLAâAL Textilesâ official website that also hosts and manages an online store, enabling further brand promotion and commercial activities to be conducted in a centralized way. âLAâAL Textilesâ products are now available worldwide via its online business platforms on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nIn order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the âLAâAL Textilesâ home deco umbrella brand, we facilitated the official registration of the first-of-its-kind export consortium enabling beneficiary companies to take on larger-scale exports and investments. The next step that we plan on taking is the establishment of a specialized light industry training and service center that will serve as a full-fledged industrial platform with production corners for: textile products, jewelry, leather and textile accessories, carpet weaving and product design development.\n\nThe UNIDO interventions have kept a strong focus on the socio-economic dimension and development of human capital, helping SMEs to embrace the digital transformation era.Â  The results from our initiative have helped to build the resilience of these enterprises, expanded brandsâ visibility and preserved businesses continuity maintaining jobs in turbulent times. Going digital has enabled a solid foundation to be established â helping SMEs in the Cis to better deal with external pressures in the future.\n\n_\\*Riccardo Savigliano serves at UNIDO as the Chief of the Agro-Industries and Skills Development Division (AIS), within the Department of Agribusiness.

provides an overview of UNIDO technical assistance projects and tools targeting SMEs and their clusters active in the creative industry. It explores how digitalization-based business management practices, industrial design, branding are strategically linked to local cultural heritage.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG8: Decent work and economic growth Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\n\nSDG9: Industry, innovation, and infrastructure Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation\n\nSubject\n\nSMEs and the implementation of the SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\ncreative industries\n\ndigitalization\n\ninnovation\n\nSMEs\n\nsustainability\n\nIn the context of post-pandemic recovery, the global outlook is still one of a protracted economic downturn with knock-on effects on efforts towards sustainable growth and transformational changes through technological innovation across industries. It is highly important to be mindful of the signs emerging from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the informal sector, as they continue to play an increasingly essential role in both job creation and the well-being of people at large. This is especially true for developing countries and countries with economies in transition, where SMEs make up the majority of industries and have been far less successful in coping with the pandemic-related slump that brought large parts of industrial production to a standstill in early 2020. Looking back to the times preceding the pandemic, their development potential was often untapped due to a number of challenges ranging from limited access to financial and government support measures to a lack of expertise in adopting dynamic development strategies in order to maintain business continuity amid a crisis. In [creative industries](https://youtu.be/IvSqMntqosQ)\n (CIs), COVID-19 has affected SMEs in a myriad of ways, literally making them the first to shut their doors. Evidence on the pandemic-related economic fallout suggests that SMEs active in CIs are also at risk, ending up among the last to fully return back on track, as they struggle to remain afloat amid shrinking customer demand, disrupted supply chains, and partial or total shutdown of related economic sectors, such as tourism. This expertise and cultural heritage are contributing to social change, and to improved livelihoods of vulnerable social groups and rural communities, including [youth, women and refugees, through new employment and entrepreneurial opportunities](https://youtu.be/LQtDrlM-8xI)\n.\n\nAlthough the crisis is still largely ongoing throughout the world, efforts are underway to address the emerging challenges. In CIs, a large portion of development and recovery solutions are becoming increasingly associated with digitalization. Offering new windows of opportunities to nurture creativity and preserve traditions, the digital realm holds significant potential, in terms of accelerating the shift to more innovative and intangibles-oriented practices, such as [industrial design, online marketing and strategic branding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5U5nB5jtSc)\n that can successfully draw upon the local origin of products, tradition and national heritage. Characterized by intense competition, digitalization also encourages the production of higher-quality goods and services that meet market demands. It can thus help improve many economic and social outcomes, and be a force to address development issues, including those related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nAgainst this backdrop, UNIDO incorporates the perspective of country-, region- and enterprise-level economic actors that are willing to reinvent their modus operandi toÂ reap the benefits offered by the digitalization era. As the need to reconcile digitalization with economic recovery comes to the forefront, UNIDO continues to expand its technical cooperation toolkit and technical assistance portfolio, while maintaining a high level of flexibility and being mindful of both emerging macroeconomic trends and the needs of its national counterparts. UNIDO has pioneered industrial design and branding among its other impactful approaches to promote and accelerate sustainable and inclusive industrial development. We have success stories in traditional and heritage-based industries, light industries and the handicraft sector where SMEs have been able to improve the quality of their products, achieve higher productivity, diversify, attract investments, contributing to improved linkages with the tourism sector.\n\nBranding draws out the transformative value of intangible assets to the forefront and is a practical solution for enterprises to transit to a more robust and competitive digital representation. The branding approach constitutes a shift away from classic growth and crisis mitigation paradigms, opening the path to unleashing innovation, creativity and distinctiveness. In other words, urging beneficiary SMEs to explore recovery solutions that are based on the local identity represents a unique competitive advantage for the country and its creative industries. UNIDOâs project implementation experience shows that branding and industrial design do give a product an identity that distinguishes it from others in the market, reinforces business resilience, and contributes to the closing of the digital divide. UNIDO supports SMEs, helping them to grasp the importance of digital solutions and reinforce their ability to build a solid customer loyalty base. By embracing this digital transformation, enterprises can stay a step ahead of their competition and lay some very important groundwork for dealing with external pressures, owing to greater market potential and more direct access to customers through a strategically planned online presence.\n\n**UNIDO success stories in Tajikistan and Armenia: Â Blending tradition and national heritage with innovative modernityÂ for high-performing home textiles and fashion brands**\n\nAmidst the pandemic, UNIDO project beneficiaries in Armenia and Tajikistan found themselves to be well-equipped to instantly adopt digital know-how, seizing online opportunities by reorienting their sales promotion activities to social media marketing tools, e-commerce and online B2B platforms. This move allowed our beneficiaries to maintain business continuity by receiving production orders and acquiring new contracts with new partners both domestically and abroad. âLAâAL Textilesâ and â5900BCâ are two unique umbrella brands established and nurtured with UNIDO technical assistance.\n\nSince 2014, UNIDO has been supporting Armenia in the revitalization of its garment industry by strengthening the technical and managerial capacities of Armenian light industry manufacturers.\n\nArmenian textile and leather manufacturers united under the â5900BCâ brand increased their technical and production potential leading to numerous fashion collections with improved design and quality that opened access to international markets. As a result of our support, a pool of experts well-versed in the fashion industry and its modern trends was created to provide regular consultations on key topics to support the generation of additional value-added.\n\nThe Armenian textile and garment industry learned how to use digital technologies and maintain business continuity when conventional marketing channels become limited or unavailable. Based on the lessons learned during the pandemic, the support from UNIDO ensured that beneficiaries operating under the â5900BCâ brand strengthen their positions in local and international markets by efficiently using the relevant digital business tools, minimizing the impact of crises-related constraints through the adoption of new market outreach vision underpinned by a strong brand identity with high-recognition value and trust from its customers.\n\nSince 2016, UNIDO focuses on industrial upgrading and the modernization of carpet-weaving, embroidery and traditional textile sectors in Tajikistan. As a result of our interventions, textiles and home deco umbrella brand âLAâAL Textilesâ was created bringing together 9 project beneficiaries that specialize in the production of home textiles, hand-woven and machine-woven carpets. Over 6 years, having inherited a blend of well-preserved traditions in carpet-weaving and embroidery with modern home decor trends the âLAâAL Textilesâ, showcased its brand and collection at numerous national and international exhibitions, winning customersâ hearts in Tajikistan and beyond. In 2019 and 2020, the endeavour further expanded to cover a wider geographical area. Additional 11 beneficiary enterprises joined the project and embarked on upgrading their business, improving their production cycle, increasing their competitiveness and enhancing product quality to eventually, gain access to markets, building on the support of national technical expertise.\n\nFurther digital transformation has since taken place, expanding the brandâs online alternative marketing and business performance optimization solutions. Beneficiaries launched the âLAâAL Textilesâ official website that also hosts and manages an online store, enabling further brand promotion and commercial activities to be conducted in a centralized way. âLAâAL Textilesâ products are now available worldwide via its online business platforms on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nIn order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the âLAâAL Textilesâ home deco umbrella brand, we facilitated the official registration of the first-of-its-kind export consortium enabling beneficiary companies to take on larger-scale exports and investments. The next step that we plan on taking is the establishment of a specialized light industry training and service center that will serve as a full-fledged industrial platform with production corners for: textile products, jewelry, leather and textile accessories, carpet weaving and product design development.\n\nThe UNIDO interventions have kept a strong focus on the socio-economic dimension and development of human capital, helping SMEs to embrace the digital transformation era.Â  The results from our initiative have helped to build the resilience of these enterprises, expanded brandsâ visibility and preserved businesses continuity maintaining jobs in turbulent times. Going digital has enabled a solid foundation to be established â helping SMEs in the Cis to better deal with external pressures in the future.\n\n_\\*Riccardo Savigliano serves at UNIDO as the Chief of the Agro-Industries and Skills Development Division (AIS), within the Department of Agribusiness.

SMEs face many challenges, conventional and novel, and we have to think differently about how best to help them.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG8: Decent work and economic growth Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\n\nSDG12: Responsible consumption and production Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\n\nSubject\n\nSMEs and the implementation of the SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\nentrepreneurship\n\ninnovation\n\nSMEs\n\nsustainability\n\nWe often hear about SMEs as the backbone of the global economy, providing most jobs and making up the vast majority of all companies on the planet, but suffering from particular gaps in capacity and access in order to increase their resilience and become more sustainable. While more work and analysis could always be done, and more focus brought to the particular problems of SMEs, at IOE we have been dealing with these issues for a long time and believe that it is now time for implementation and concrete policy changes at scale. The current crisis has exacerbated many existing issues and also added additional pressures for business continuity and development; as countries prepare different recovery measures, it is the perfect time to focus on SMEs with dedicated support and sustainability incentives. We know many solutions and ways of supporting SMEs but more often than not the problem is implementation, actually going ahead with evidence-based, coherent and dedicated policies, and the means to implement them in a timely and efficient manner. We hear less about the structural and persistent issues facing small businesses in some contexts and how these systemic issues have not improved much in recent decades. For example, according to the ILO, there are about 365-445 million MSMEs in emerging markets: 25-30 million are formal SMEs, 55-70 million are formal micro, and 285-345 million are informal enterprises; this illustrates the scale that we need to reach to have a long-lasting impact. Looking at it another way, formal SMEs contribute up to 40% of national income (GDP) in emerging economies and significantly more when informal SMEs are included.\n\nIn the context of responding to shocks and crises, the resilience of a company is one of the main ways we can assess its readiness to adapt and respond to external disruptions. Resilience is based on the strength of a companyâs business processes, its internal and external connections and its ability to pivot. Unfortunately, small businesses are usually less resilient than large businesses yet they often face even stronger challenges during these periods. According to International Trade Center (ITC) research, 68% of the companies interviewed in sub-Saharan Africa said that environmental risks were significant for their businesses, yet just 38% of micro, small and medium-sized firms had made an investment in at least one measure to reduce exposure to environmental risks compared to 60% of large firms. Some of the elements more resilient companies had in place according to ITC, are connections to business support organizations, peers and buyers, innovation, employees with the right skills, and access to funds. Many companies adopting more sustainable business practices are reporting positive effects on their business operations and the business case for adopting some of these innovative practices is growing stronger. Among the potential benefits of measures such as increasing energy efficiency, switching to renewable energy, reducing and recycling waste are: increased resilience, cost reduction and higher productivity, compliance with climate regulations, access to markets, and eligibility for green financing. However, it is important to note that these benefits depend strongly on local context, policies and business environments. Solutions need to be catered to national contexts and evidence-based; collaboration between government and private sector, with the coordination of employer and business organisations, is crucial for effective implementation.\n\nIn Ethiopia, SMEs and business owners have to contend with structural issues on a daily basis, regular and affordable access to electricity is not a given, getting funding and easily establishing an affordable credit line sounds like a dream, and finding employees with the skills you wish for can be quite the challenge. Even if you surmount these challenges and successfully establish business operations, an unexpected event like the Covid pandemic could turn your hard-earned effort upside down with little hope for assistance and support from the public sector. All this while facing other adverse factors like competition from informal enterprises who donât go through the added effort of following regulations and through the bureaucracy needed to establish a formal enterprise. This is how Dawit Moges, President of the Ethiopian Employersâ Federation, described some of the challenges facing small businesses in his home country during a recent IOE side-event at the recent UN ECOSOC Partnership Forum.\n\nThis is why IOE believes much more needs to be done to improve the environment in which SMEs operate in every country but particularly in less industrialised regions where business frameworks sometimes suffer from structural and systemic issues that put a brake on growth and development. IOE is in the middle of an ambitious project with 26 national employersâ organisations, from the list of least developed countries (LDCs), to analyse the local business environment in collaboration with stakeholders on the ground and provide a concise snapshot of what needs to be done to improve the conditions of doing business. This analysis can then be used as a roadmap and a policy tool, and local business development services can be boosted through government and employersâ organisation collaboration. This work would also have been showcased and promoted at the LDC5 Conference in Doha, Qatar, which is a great opportunity to discuss some of these pressing issues but it was unfortunately postponed. IOE also hosted one of the Spotlight Sessions of the UN ECOSOC Partnership Forum which was focused on SMEs and their particular challenges. You can see stories of entrepreneurs and their experiences and struggles across different countries in the Business Heroes series of videos IOE prepared to promote the plight of small business owners worldwide.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Figure-1-Business-development-phases-ILO-2020-e1644940409826.png)\n\nFigure 1 Business development phases (ILO, 2020)\n\nILO analysis on entrepreneurship and the system conditions for developing enterprises can provide some useful insights. According to research, proper access to financing as well as business development services provided over 1-2 years are crucial for enabling âentrepreneurs to increase income, expand their enterprises, as well as create jobs, beyond what would have been possible with finance alone; and at the same time, allowed financial institutions to realize higher client retention as well as a larger, more skilled client baseâ. It seems it is easy to overlook the complexity and difficulty of launching and running a new business without appropriate support. A good question to ask oneself, if I were to launch a business tomorrow what would it be? How many of us have a successful business idea just waiting to be implemented, and how many are certain it would work and be successful in the long term? Now hold onto that and ask yourself if that business idea is sustainable and perfectly emission-free? In most countries of the world, it is currently more difficult to operate a sustainable business than a conventional one. Furthermore, the SDGs are a complex and exhaustive agenda with many different elements and components as well as objectives that can sometimes be in partial conflict. For example, I can be an SME owner in the food sector and therefore directly contribute to Goal 2 by distributing quality food to a local population, but at the same time I am using fossil fuel vehicles for this distribution and my electricity comes from the national grid which is powered by a large share of coal power plants. In this scenario, Iâm contributing to one SDG already but I am also preventing SDG7 from being reached due to the fossil fuel sources of my energy consumption. Now, I could potentially try and replace my vehicles with electric ones and I could try finding alternative sources of electricity but if my business is in a country that lacks electric charging stations, or where the electricity grid does not offer green energy, some of my sustainability options are limited.\n\nWe have to look at the whole system and act on some of the framework conditions which are impeding action. SMEs are usually in dynamic and competitive markets and they operate on a business logic. Unless there are incentives for alternatives and those alternatives are easy to access most business owners default to the easiest and cheapest option. And most of the easiest and cheapest options are not sustainable in most places of the world today. We have to have a more detailed system way and look at, on the one hand, the entrepreneurial ecosystem (Figure 2) while also looking at the industrial system and access to sustainable products and services in any given market.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Figure-2-Entrepreneurial-ecosystem-ILO-2020.png)\n\nFigure 2 Entrepreneurial ecosystem (ILO, 2020)\n\nThe SDGs cover many aspects and most businesses of all sizes already have a positive impact on some of the SDGs. However, they also have a negative or neutral impact on others. So business owners need to look at the areas theyâve been ignoring or areas where they could make a difference without significant drawbacks. Cutting energy costs with efficiency measures, improving diversity at the workplace, reducing material costs with more efficient processes or simply cutting out some parts which are not necessary could all be relatively quickly implemented and would have immediate benefits. Furthermore, the credit gap results from both demand and supply-side problems. Many SMEs are reluctant to seek or cannot access credit due to the reams of financial documentation and collateral requirements for obtaining a loan; high costs and interest rates; and multi-week decision timeframes. Digitizing SME finance and making use of transactional and alternative data offer an opportunity for addressing both sides of this problem according to World Bank analysis.\n\nNovel approaches and methods like the circular economy offer promising paths to creating economic growth and value while also ensuring sustainability objectives are met and emissions reduced. However, they require the whole system to develop and adapt and this takes time. Other approaches for developing markets and optimizing their performance could also have promising impacts, like the efforts of ILOâs Lab and the Market Systems Development approach.  \nMost businesses are still in a conventional system with conventional processes, methods and services and are trying to survive a harsh competitive environment which can sometimes be exacerbated by unexpected shocks. As we have seen with Covid, most businesses donât respond very well to strong shocks that require them to quickly adapt. They require stability, clarity and support in implementing gradual changes.\n\nCreating real change for SMEs and scaling up sustainability efforts and progress across the world for small and medium companies requires dedicated, persistent and systemic efforts which need to be done in close collaboration between private and public sectors. There are many initiatives and projects already out there, Deloitte has collected some inspiring stories of SMEs innovating for example while the International Trade Center (ITC) also collects inspiring experiences from SMEs and their challenges. Employersâ and business membership organisations can be key partners in this process, acting as the bridge to some of these less exposed companies that require support and also as a gateway to the government, to create practical policy changes, drive incentives where they are needed and provide feedback from the ground. So on the one hand the information and knowledge available to entrepreneurs, business owners and consumers relating to sustainability opportunities need to be improved, but on the other hand the business environment, local policies, overly restrictive regulations and bureaucracy, dedicated lines of support and targeted incentives all need to be changed in order to spur more sustainable SMEs and create a greener business environment. IOE is working on many of these issues with its members and strives to promote the importance of employers and business organisations in the development of local business communities.\n\n_\\*IOE Adviser Robert Marinkovic deals with climate change policy and issues related to the implementation of the 2030 agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals, the green economy and just transition.A political science BA graduate from the University of Geneva (Switzerland) and with an MSc in Environmental Science also from the University of Geneva Robert started working for the City of Geneva in its Agenda 21 Office, followed with an internship at UN Environment before settling at the International Labour Organization in Geneva for some time with the RELMEETINGS department.

SMEs\n========================================================================================\n\nMicrolearning\n\n ![UN SDG:Learn logo](https://www.unsdglearn.org/img/logo_sdglearn_white.svg)

role SMEs play in improving the business environment at the country level and needs to be involved in more public-private collaboration and discussion. SMEs face many challenges, conventional and novel, and we have to think differently about how best to help them.\n\nTopics\n------\n\nSDG\n\nSDG8: Decent work and economic growth Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all\n\nSDG12: Responsible consumption and production Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\n\nSubject\n\nSMEs and the implementation of the SDGs\n\nKeywords\n\nentrepreneurship\n\ninnovation\n\nSMEs\n\nsustainability\n\nWe often hear about SMEs as the backbone of the global economy, providing most jobs and making up the vast majority of all companies on the planet, but suffering from particular gaps in capacity and access in order to increase their resilience and become more sustainable. While more work and analysis could always be done, and more focus brought to the particular problems of SMEs, at IOE we have been dealing with these issues for a long time and believe that it is now time for implementation and concrete policy changes at scale. The current crisis has exacerbated many existing issues and also added additional pressures for business continuity and development; as countries prepare different recovery measures, it is the perfect time to focus on SMEs with dedicated support and sustainability incentives. We know many solutions and ways of supporting SMEs but more often than not the problem is implementation, actually going ahead with evidence-based, coherent and dedicated policies, and the means to implement them in a timely and efficient manner. We hear less about the structural and persistent issues facing small businesses in some contexts and how these systemic issues have not improved much in recent decades. For example, according to the ILO, there are about 365-445 million MSMEs in emerging markets: 25-30 million are formal SMEs, 55-70 million are formal micro, and 285-345 million are informal enterprises; this illustrates the scale that we need to reach to have a long-lasting impact. Looking at it another way, formal SMEs contribute up to 40% of national income (GDP) in emerging economies and significantly more when informal SMEs are included.\n\nIn the context of responding to shocks and crises, the resilience of a company is one of the main ways we can assess its readiness to adapt and respond to external disruptions. Resilience is based on the strength of a companyâs business processes, its internal and external connections and its ability to pivot. Unfortunately, small businesses are usually less resilient than large businesses yet they often face even stronger challenges during these periods. According to International Trade Center (ITC) research, 68% of the companies interviewed in sub-Saharan Africa said that environmental risks were significant for their businesses, yet just 38% of micro, small and medium-sized firms had made an investment in at least one measure to reduce exposure to environmental risks compared to 60% of large firms. Some of the elements more resilient companies had in place according to ITC, are connections to business support organizations, peers and buyers, innovation, employees with the right skills, and access to funds. Many companies adopting more sustainable business practices are reporting positive effects on their business operations and the business case for adopting some of these innovative practices is growing stronger. Among the potential benefits of measures such as increasing energy efficiency, switching to renewable energy, reducing and recycling waste are: increased resilience, cost reduction and higher productivity, compliance with climate regulations, access to markets, and eligibility for green financing. However, it is important to note that these benefits depend strongly on local context, policies and business environments. Solutions need to be catered to national contexts and evidence-based; collaboration between government and private sector, with the coordination of employer and business organisations, is crucial for effective implementation.\n\nIn Ethiopia, SMEs and business owners have to contend with structural issues on a daily basis, regular and affordable access to electricity is not a given, getting funding and easily establishing an affordable credit line sounds like a dream, and finding employees with the skills you wish for can be quite the challenge. Even if you surmount these challenges and successfully establish business operations, an unexpected event like the Covid pandemic could turn your hard-earned effort upside down with little hope for assistance and support from the public sector. All this while facing other adverse factors like competition from informal enterprises who donât go through the added effort of following regulations and through the bureaucracy needed to establish a formal enterprise. This is how Dawit Moges, President of the Ethiopian Employersâ Federation, described some of the challenges facing small businesses in his home country during a recent IOE side-event at the recent UN ECOSOC Partnership Forum.\n\nThis is why IOE believes much more needs to be done to improve the environment in which SMEs operate in every country but particularly in less industrialised regions where business frameworks sometimes suffer from structural and systemic issues that put a brake on growth and development. IOE is in the middle of an ambitious project with 26 national employersâ organisations, from the list of least developed countries (LDCs), to analyse the local business environment in collaboration with stakeholders on the ground and provide a concise snapshot of what needs to be done to improve the conditions of doing business. This analysis can then be used as a roadmap and a policy tool, and local business development services can be boosted through government and employersâ organisation collaboration. This work would also have been showcased and promoted at the LDC5 Conference in Doha, Qatar, which is a great opportunity to discuss some of these pressing issues but it was unfortunately postponed. IOE also hosted one of the Spotlight Sessions of the UN ECOSOC Partnership Forum which was focused on SMEs and their particular challenges. You can see stories of entrepreneurs and their experiences and struggles across different countries in the Business Heroes series of videos IOE prepared to promote the plight of small business owners worldwide.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Figure-1-Business-development-phases-ILO-2020-e1644940409826.png)\n\nFigure 1 Business development phases (ILO, 2020)\n\nILO analysis on entrepreneurship and the system conditions for developing enterprises can provide some useful insights. According to research, proper access to financing as well as business development services provided over 1-2 years are crucial for enabling âentrepreneurs to increase income, expand their enterprises, as well as create jobs, beyond what would have been possible with finance alone; and at the same time, allowed financial institutions to realize higher client retention as well as a larger, more skilled client baseâ. It seems it is easy to overlook the complexity and difficulty of launching and running a new business without appropriate support. A good question to ask oneself, if I were to launch a business tomorrow what would it be? How many of us have a successful business idea just waiting to be implemented, and how many are certain it would work and be successful in the long term? Now hold onto that and ask yourself if that business idea is sustainable and perfectly emission-free? In most countries of the world, it is currently more difficult to operate a sustainable business than a conventional one. Furthermore, the SDGs are a complex and exhaustive agenda with many different elements and components as well as objectives that can sometimes be in partial conflict. For example, I can be an SME owner in the food sector and therefore directly contribute to Goal 2 by distributing quality food to a local population, but at the same time I am using fossil fuel vehicles for this distribution and my electricity comes from the national grid which is powered by a large share of coal power plants. In this scenario, Iâm contributing to one SDG already but I am also preventing SDG7 from being reached due to the fossil fuel sources of my energy consumption. Now, I could potentially try and replace my vehicles with electric ones and I could try finding alternative sources of electricity but if my business is in a country that lacks electric charging stations, or where the electricity grid does not offer green energy, some of my sustainability options are limited.\n\nWe have to look at the whole system and act on some of the framework conditions which are impeding action. SMEs are usually in dynamic and competitive markets and they operate on a business logic. Unless there are incentives for alternatives and those alternatives are easy to access most business owners default to the easiest and cheapest option. And most of the easiest and cheapest options are not sustainable in most places of the world today. We have to have a more detailed system way and look at, on the one hand, the entrepreneurial ecosystem (Figure 2) while also looking at the industrial system and access to sustainable products and services in any given market.\n\n![](https://www.unsdglearn.org/files/unsdglearn/Figure-2-Entrepreneurial-ecosystem-ILO-2020.png)\n\nFigure 2 Entrepreneurial ecosystem (ILO, 2020)\n\nThe SDGs cover many aspects and most businesses of all sizes already have a positive impact on some of the SDGs. However, they also have a negative or neutral impact on others. So business owners need to look at the areas theyâve been ignoring or areas where they could make a difference without significant drawbacks. Cutting energy costs with efficiency measures, improving diversity at the workplace, reducing material costs with more efficient processes or simply cutting out some parts which are not necessary could all be relatively quickly implemented and would have immediate benefits. Furthermore, the credit gap results from both demand and supply-side problems. Many SMEs are reluctant to seek or cannot access credit due to the reams of financial documentation and collateral requirements for obtaining a loan; high costs and interest rates; and multi-week decision timeframes. Digitizing SME finance and making use of transactional and alternative data offer an opportunity for addressing both sides of this problem according to World Bank analysis.\n\nNovel approaches and methods like the circular economy offer promising paths to creating economic growth and value while also ensuring sustainability objectives are met and emissions reduced. However, they require the whole system to develop and adapt and this takes time. Other approaches for developing markets and optimizing their performance could also have promising impacts, like the efforts of ILOâs Lab and the Market Systems Development approach.  \nMost businesses are still in a conventional system with conventional processes, methods and services and are trying to survive a harsh competitive environment which can sometimes be exacerbated by unexpected shocks. As we have seen with Covid, most businesses donât respond very well to strong shocks that require them to quickly adapt. They require stability, clarity and support in implementing gradual changes.\n\nCreating real change for SMEs and scaling up sustainability efforts and progress across the world for small and medium companies requires dedicated, persistent and systemic efforts which need to be done in close collaboration between private and public sectors. There are many initiatives and projects already out there, Deloitte has collected some inspiring stories of SMEs innovating for example while the International Trade Center (ITC) also collects inspiring experiences from SMEs and their challenges. Employersâ and business membership organisations can be key partners in this process, acting as the bridge to some of these less exposed companies that require support and also as a gateway to the government, to create practical policy changes, drive incentives where they are needed and provide feedback from the ground. So on the one hand the information and knowledge available to entrepreneurs, business owners and consumers relating to sustainability opportunities need to be improved, but on the other hand the business environment, local policies, overly restrictive regulations and bureaucracy, dedicated lines of support and targeted incentives all need to be changed in order to spur more sustainable SMEs and create a greener business environment. IOE is working on many of these issues with its members and strives to promote the importance of employers and business organisations in the development of local business communities.\n\n_\\*IOE Adviser Robert Marinkovic deals with climate change policy and issues related to the implementation of the 2030 agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals, the green economy and just transition.A political science BA graduate from the University of Geneva (Switzerland) and with an MSc in Environmental Science also from the University of Geneva Robert started working for the City of Geneva in its Agenda 21 Office, followed with an internship at UN Environment before settling at the International Labour Organization in Geneva for some time with the RELMEETINGS department.

These needs have emerged because COVID-19 has made clear that our supply chains are weak; our governments are slow in responding to a crisis, waiting at first to then overreact at a later stage; before embracing the crisis, individualism dominates public opinion as much as nationalism dominates public policy.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many positive outcomes that COVID-19 has brought to the table of just about every citizen of the World. First, change is possible. Second, we know what to do. Third, the time to act is now. Let me explain why I see these three developments as the opportunities of a lifetime.\n\nI have studied Systems Thinking and [System Dynamics](https://systemdynamics.org/)\n at the beginning of the century. I have worked with these methods on a daily basis, for way more hours than I care to admit, for the past 20 years. These last two decades have been a rollercoaster for me. Working on sustainable development, I have lived moments of great excitement and motivation as well as periods of discomfort and resignation. I can remember as if it were yesterday that, when standing on a white sandy beach in Mauritius in a cloudless evening, after a long day at work, I felt like I could swim to Antarctica and back. That day I met the Prime Minister of Mauritius and had the opportunity to talk to him about the use of [integrated models](https://www.un-page.org/files/public/content-page/unep_models_ge_for_web.pdf)\n, based on systems thinking, to inform policymaking and the concept of [Maurice Ile Durable](https://www.greengrowthknowledge.org/national-documents/maurice-ile-durable-policy-strategy-and-action-plan)\n (Mauritius Sustainable Island) that he had just launched. I had endless energy and motivation that evening. At the same time, I remember very well being on a train in December 2009, on the way back from [COP15 in Copenhagen](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/past-conferences/copenhagen-climate-change-conference-december-2009/cop-15/cop-15-decisions)\n, being exhausted. It was not physical exhaustion, it was mental, emotional. COP15 was not the first large, international gathering I attended, but somehow I had high expectations for its outcomes. It turned out instead to be a colossal missed opportunity in my eyes.\n\nTreasuring successes, learning from frustration, and having spent most of my professional life working with systems approaches I am deeply convinced that the road ahead is extremely clear. We need to [connect the dots](https://www.ke-srl.com/tackling-complexity)\n, develop policies and implement investments that simultaneously generate benefits across economic sectors, for all economic actors, for all dimensions of development (or SDGs), as well as over time. It is not that difficult to plan, it is a whole different challenge to put it into practice.\n\nSo where does COVID-19 come into play? In my eyes, COVID-19 is an enabler for the changes that will come in the next 20-30 years. Without such a global socio-economic crisis, coupled with the ongoing environmental crisis, we would not have the courage to act and take our planetary future in our hands.\n\nFirst, COVID-19 has made it clear that change is possible. The international community spent decades debating whether and how to address sustainability concerns, discussing how expensive it would be to reduce emissions to limit global warming. In a single year, the [amount of resources](https://www.iisd.org/sustainable-recovery/trackers/energy-policy-tracker/)\n mobilized to support the economy in the aftermath of the global pandemic made investments in climate mitigation and adaptation seem small, and [even undersized](https://www.iisd.org/articles/covid-19-green-recovery-trackers-statement)\n.\n\nSecond, we know what to do. Systems approaches have been available for several decades. Specifically, Systems Thinking and System Dynamics were created in the late 1950s and have been applied to sustainable development since. Issues related to sustainable development have been known for a similar amount of time, if not longer. For instance, modern forms of renewable energy for power generation saw initial developments in the 1980s, as a result of the oil crisis. Denmark pioneered investments in wind power generation at that time, to become a world leader for technology development two decades after. Methods are known, we are familiar with the issues, and we also know what solutions are most effective. The solutions we need now are not that different from those identified in the context of [Green Economy](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?page=view&type=400&nr=126&menu=35)\n planning, the main strategy discussed at the Rio+20 conference. As a result, we know well that sustainable investments generate benefits across social, economic and environmental indicators.\n\nThird, the time to act is now. COVID-19 has taught us that decisive action is needed if we want to have an immediate and lasting impact. Waiting, when we are headed towards a crisis, does not help. Resistance to change, in a deteriorating context, can only make the situation worse. What COVID-19 has also made explicit, is that for the first time we are all citizens of the World, living on the same planet. This is true for the public and private sector, as well as for households. We have all been impacted by COVID-19, because of our actions and the actions of others, indistinctly. Still, we have all acted to improve the situation, moved by the same goal.\n\nThese three outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic show me that (i) hope itâs not lost for sustainable development, on the contrary (ii) we know that change is possible if we act now and we commit to a more sustainable future for all.\n\nAs I mention earlier, now that the stage is set, there is only one way forward to plan for, and realize a more sustainable future effectively, and maximizing value for money: we all need to use a systemic approach.\n\nWhat does this mean? It basically implies that we consider the possible social, economic and environmental outcomes of our actions. We proceed with the actions that do not maximize economic outcomes over social or environmental performance. Instead, we chose options that generate benefits across all dimensions of development, simultaneously. When this is not possible, and tradeoffs emerge, we begin immediately to plan for complementary measures that could prevent the emergence of side effects. We donât have the luxury to proceed with a trial and error approach, we have scarce resources and little time, it is crucial that we start planning systemically.\n\nThis is of course easier said than done. We are good at preparing excellent plans that gather dust on a shelf, I have prepared many of these for several governments. We have been handed a shock that allows us to break the impasse, and this shock has to be seen as an opportunity. We canât go back to âbusiness as usualâ. We need to change institutions, making so that they support integrated planning, by rewarding performance towards multi-dimensional targets, such as the SDGs, rather than with a focus on sectoral plans. This is critical, because policy coherence, especially at a time of crisis, can only emerge from institutions that work coherently, without internal competition. This being said, I am yet to see important changes in budget allocations, from a ministry to another, because investing in one area (e.g. renewable energy) can reduce costs in another (e.g. [health](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240036369)\n, via a reduction of air pollution).\n\nSystems thinking can play a critical role in supporting such institutional transition. This is because systems approaches can serve as â[knowledge integrators](https://www.sciendo.com/article/10.1515/rtuect-2015-0009)\nâ. They support the creation of a shared understanding, bringing people, experts, professionals and decision makers together via a co-creation and a multi-stakeholder approach. Systems thinking provides a platform to share ideas and opinions, and supports the visualizations of the complexity we deal with. Practically, it brings diverse audiences âon the same pageâ. This is possible because systems approaches are being used by the [private sector](https://www.iisd.org/savi/nbi/)\n (e.g. for supply chain management), by [governments](https://lcdi-indonesia.id/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GE-Report-English-8-Oct-lowres.pdf)\n (e.g. for national and sectoral development plans) and by civil society (e.g. for social and [environmental assessments](https://nbi.iisd.org/report/investment-in-nature-close-infrastructure-gap/)\n), allowing to find a neutral space for communication and exchange of opinions.\n\nMore critically, given that we are living in a more and more interconnected World and where change is continuously accelerating, the need for the use of a systems approach simply emerges from any and all conversation we entertain. I canât recall a situation in which, discussing about economics with colleagues and peers, we only touched upon economic indicators; or when discussing about energy dynamics we only talked about energy demand supply. It is common nowadays to explain an economic event by discussing social and environmental dynamics; or to discuss social concerns, by considering economic and environmental concerns; or by linking economic and behavioral choices to environmental degradation.\n\nThe need for the use of systems approaches is in front of our eyes; there is no arguing their relevance and usefulness, not from where we stand right now. COVID-19 may have accelerated this transition also, but it is our responsibility to push it forward and commit to it for the long term, now that the wheels are in motion. We know that change is possible, we know what to do, and we know that the time to act is now. I have always known that using a systems approach is the only way to go for sustainable development, and I am convinced that COVID-19 has brought us the opportunity of a lifetime, one we will not miss.\n\n_\\* Dr. Andrea M.

This is possible because systems approaches are being used by the [private sector](https://www.iisd.org/savi/nbi/)\n (e.g. for supply chain management), by [governments](https://lcdi-indonesia.id/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GE-Report-English-8-Oct-lowres.pdf)\n (e.g. for national and sectoral development plans) and by civil society (e.g. for social and [environmental assessments](https://nbi.iisd.org/report/investment-in-nature-close-infrastructure-gap/)\n), allowing to find a neutral space for communication and exchange of opinions.\n\nMore critically, given that we are living in a more and more interconnected World and where change is continuously accelerating, the need for the use of a systems approach simply emerges from any and all conversation we entertain. I canât recall a situation in which, discussing about economics with colleagues and peers, we only touched upon economic indicators; or when discussing about energy dynamics we only talked about energy demand supply. It is common nowadays to explain an economic event by discussing social and environmental dynamics; or to discuss social concerns, by considering economic and environmental concerns; or by linking economic and behavioral choices to environmental degradation.\n\nThe need for the use of systems approaches is in front of our eyes; there is no arguing their relevance and usefulness, not from where we stand right now. COVID-19 may have accelerated this transition also, but it is our responsibility to push it forward and commit to it for the long term, now that the wheels are in motion. We know that change is possible, we know what to do, and we know that the time to act is now. I have always known that using a systems approach is the only way to go for sustainable development, and I am convinced that COVID-19 has brought us the opportunity of a lifetime, one we will not miss.\n\n_\\* Dr. Andrea M.

emotional intelligence, mindfulness, and resilience. These inner qualities are critical for addressing the complex challenges of our time and for driving meaningful, systemic change towards sustainability. Our discussion withÂ Ãsa Jarskog, the Director Global Collaboration of the Inner Development GoalsÂ will cover the origins, development, and applications of the IDG framework, showcasing how it equips individuals, communities, and organizations with the inner skills needed to effectively contribute to the global sustainable development agenda. Let us unlock the synergy between inner transformation and outer action, illuminating a holistic path to achieving a sustainable future for all.\n\n_\\[What follows is a transcription of the podcast, modified for enhanced web readability.\\]_  \n**Paulyn Duman****:** Welcome to the SDG Learncast with me, Paulyn Duman. In every episode, I bring insightful conversations around the subject of sustainable development and learning, helping us all to achieve a sustainable future.\n\nIn this podcast episode, we will look into the transformative power of the Inner Development Goals, or IDGs, and how they support achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, or the SDGs.\n\nIn this episode, we will explore how the IDGs complement the SDGs by focusing on the inner dimensions of change, such as self-awareness, emotional intelligence, mindfulness, and resilience. As our guest, we have Ms. Ãsa Jarkskog, who is the director for global collaboration of the Inner Development Goals. Welcome to the SDG Learncast, Ãsa.\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog****:** Thank you, Paulyn. It's wonderful to be here with you today.\n\n**Paulyn Duman: Ãsa, tell us about yourself and how you came to work with the IDGs.**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** I've been working with sustainable development in one way or another since 1990, when I started a career with the UN. When the SDGs were launched, I was very thrilled that finally, we had an agenda that was approved by all countries, and we had common goals and clear indicators on how to reach a more sustainable world, and it felt quite comprehensive. But with time, I think I share this frustration with many people.\n\nI realized that we are not reaching those targets, even though we do have the resources on a global basis, and we do have the technology. Somewhere, we must be doing something wrong. That's when I came across the IDGs and felt that they were the missing link.\n\n**Paulyn Duman: And what is your role within the Inner Development Goals?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** When I joined the IDGs, they were quite big in Sweden. It's a fairly young organization. It was launched three years ago; we just celebrated our third-year anniversary. But having worked myself in 61 different countries, I was approached by the IDGs and asked to bring the framework out to the world and, in particular, to the Global South.\n\nMy response was, \"No, I'm not going to bring something to the Global South, but I can go into a dialogue with people from other backgrounds and see what their take on this framework is. I believe we may need to redefine the framework when we go into that conversation.\"\n\nThat's what's happening now. We are doing a global survey where we are redefining the particular skills that the framework currently presents. I'm from Sweden, and when somebody talks about the SDGs and sustainability in Sweden, they're very much focused on the climate crisis, which is the biggest challenge we have here in Sweden. But in many of the countries I have lived and worked in, poverty, hunger, access to education, access to healthâthose are the big challenges that people are dealing with.\n\nSo what I have done is have this dialogue with many different countries and also co-create a capacity development program where we link the IDGs to the SDGs and see how by integrating inner development, not only on an individual level but also on the organizational level and on a systemic level, (we can see) how that can actually contribute to a more sustainable society.\n\n**Paulyn Duman: What inspired the inception of this IDG framework?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** The people that initiated the research were sharing this frustration about the world not becoming more sustainable, or not at the pace we need, and started to look at what the human capacities are that are necessary to develop in order to reach a more sustainable world. Because if it's not about money or resources, it has to have something to do with the ones that actually created these problems in the first place, which is us, human beings.\n\nThere's a lot of research out there that is pointing in that direction, that if we can develop skills like empathy and compassion, for instance, we would become better equipped at working with sustainability. A number of academic institutions, especially in the Western world but also (in) other parts of the world, did a global survey and started looking at what those human capacities would be.\n\nIt was agreed that let's divide these different capacities, human capacities, into five dimensions, and those dimensions are being (how we relate to ourselves), thinking (that's our cognitive skills), relating (how we relate with other people and the world), collaborating, and the last dimension is acting. Extremely important because all the other ones are important, but if you cannot act upon them, change will not happen.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** What is important for me is that we all want to have this journey towards a more sustainable future. **What do you think are the key inner skills and qualities that the IDGs framework highlights as essential? And how do these foster effective leadership, decision-making, and community engagement?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** Actually, for me, it's very difficult to highlight one or two skills or capacities. It's more important to look at the framework as such and the dimensions, because each of us may have skills that we are confident talking about, for instance, self-awareness, to understand our own motivations and impulses. (Or) critical thinkingâwe are in a world of a lot of fake news, and to be able to determine what is trustworthy is much more important than ever.\n\nI feel that currently, empathy and compassion are extremely important, and empathy and compassion are not very often valued when it comes to people in government ministries or military leaders, but they are extremely important in order to work for a more sustainable world. (Also) communication skills, perseverance in actingâand I think we must not lose hope, so perseverance is also extremely important.\n\nOn a global basis, there is one capacity that I have seen that we are lacking in so many parts of the world, and that is trust. But the good news is that we can improve on all these skills. We can continue to develop as human beings for the rest of our lives.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** At the global scale, what is missing is trust, but this is something that we can work on, what we can build on, we can improve.\n\n**How are the IDGs integrated at the organizational level or at the sectoral level? And what are some of the challenges and breakthroughs that you have surveyed in embedding these inner skills in various sectors committed to the Sustainable Development Goals?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** One of the challenges for the IDGs is to be able to communicate with all sectors of society, with all different stakeholders, not only with individuals in civil society but also with the corporate world, academia, (and) government.\n\nWe also collaborate with the UN, and usually, these groups do not always meet together, so we are trying to speak a language that everybody can relate to. To integrate inner development on an individual level is not easy to start with, but it is much easier than to do it on an organizational level. And eventually, to integrate it on a systemic level, you need to really build trust and collaborate with other stakeholder groups in your society.\n\nIn the educational system, it's been integrated, for instance, in India, in the National Education Policy 2020, that has a key role for developing inner skills. Of course, to have these policies actually implemented all over the schools is something that takes time, but we have seenâand I had the pleasure of hosting a track in our IDG Summit last year in Stockholmâwhere there were some kids on stage that described how they have strengthened themselves through IDG training and, for instance, how the level of bullying has been reduced extremely in their schools.\n\nNaturally, we also need to work on the policy level. We cannot only work with the children. We are working with the OECD; we're collaborating with the OECD, and they have researchers working with the PISA framework in order to highlight which indicators in the PISA framework that can actually support (the) integration of IDGs into schools. There are already some of those indicators in the framework, so it's partly a question of highlighting them. The more we can get that into the educational system, the more that our future leaders will be equipped to operate in the complex world that they are going to lead.\n\nThe first government that was very keen on the IDGs was the government of Costa Rica. And they immediately said that they wanted to integrate this into their policies, into the guidelines for policy development of their country.\n\nBut I'm currently leading a global capacity development program where there are representatives from (the) governments of many other countries: India, Albania, Tunisia, the UK, the Netherlands. I worked with Rwanda and Zambia, and they also participate in these training programs to integrate inner development (into) the operations of their organizations, and eventually into their systems.\n\nIn the corporate (world), it's a bit easier because it was a long time ago when the corporate world understood that culture eats strategy. We have been working with big companies such as Ikea, Spotify, Houdini, Novartis, et cetera. So that is probably the easiest area for us when it comes to introducing Inner Development Goals.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** That is amazing. (It's) interesting, especially now with the emergence of generative AI in the last months. The paradox is really that the most valuable skills of all in the future will be those intrinsically, blatantly human. These are critical thinking, collaboration, communication, (and) creativityâso, out-and-out human collaboration.\n\n(The) IDG framework emphasizes presence, mindfulness, and long-term orientation. People have to go out of their short-term thinking. But given the perceptions that the IDGs might be seen as esoteric or overly sentimental, **how do you address these views and demonstrate the practical relevance and impact of IDGs on achieving sustainable development?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** Thank you, Paulyn. It's a good question, and that was actually my view of the IDGs as well before I unpacked them and somebody helped me to unpack it. As I mentioned to you, the IDGs consist of five dimensions: that's the being, thinking, relating, collaborating, and acting. Now, if you take capacities like mindfulness (and) presence, they are very much in the being dimension.\n\nLong-term orientation is very much in the thinking (dimension). But we should not forget that we have also included skills like co-creation and mobilizationâskills (that) are extremely important. They are in the collaborating dimension. And in the acting (dimension), we have courage, creativity, (and) optimism. So it's about developing in all the different areas. And one thing we do is, to (begin with), look at, am I too much in the acting (dimension)? Maybe I need to sometimes pause and be present and take perspectives. I'm one of those people. I really like to act.\n\nOf course, people who are my opposite, those are the ones I really need to team up with because they are better at reflecting and looking at different perspectives, et cetera. So the framework is not there to promote one way of being but (to look at) how we can complement each other to actually make change happen in this world, to take the worldâthrough the individuals and the organizations and the systemsâthrough this painful but absolutely necessary transformation.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** You mentioned creativity, and this is a really crucial component in overcoming sustainable development challenges. **Can you tell us how the IDGs encourage these qualities in individuals or organizations that are working towards achieving the SDGs, particularly if they're not creative?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** Oh, that's a very good question. I've done a lot of leadership training in many different countries, and I've often had the question posed to me, \"How do I make my organization more innovative?\" And I think my first answer has been, \"What is the trust level in your organization? And how much psychological safety is there in your organization?\" If people feel that they need to perform all the time and they're not allowed to make any mistakes, then of course they're not going to be innovative, because being innovative requires some mistakes along the way. But then as a leader, if you tell other people that they can make mistakes, but you are not willing to make any mistakes yourself because you want to be perfect, then, of course, they are not going to (be innovative). You need to walk the talk.\n\nSo it's very much about being on a journey together and co-creating, and embracing the mistakes that actually take us to innovation. I don't know how much you know about the U theory that has been developed at MIT, but we work very closely with MIT as one of our partners. And I did U Lab myself 10 years ago.\n\nAnd it's very much about not downloading what you already know, but actually sensing the future as it comes to you. And then, we need to use different languages in different kinds of organizations. When we enter a government office, we don't start by meditating with them and (saying), \"What is emerging to you?\"\n\nOn the other hand, we have a beautiful network of hubs, which is not (a) particular format of organization. It's just people that, or organizations or whatever, that want to contribute to the development of the IDG work. And we have 550 hubs all over the world in 95 different countries. And what we try to do when we work with the hubs is really just to enable whatever wants to emerge, and a lot of innovation and creativity is taking place in the hubs and networks.\n\n**Paulyn Duman: What is an insight that you have observed so that people who feel like they're lacking creativity can overcome the fear of committing mistakes and being perfectionists?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** That's difficult to give a formula (for), but I've been running a lot of different capacity development programs throughout the years. And I think my main lesson is that less is more. We just recently had a gathering in Tunisia, and when we arrived there, my colleagues were asking me, \"So where are the PowerPoints and where is the projector?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"No, we didn't take people all the way to Tunisia to show them slides. We can do that online. We are here to get to know each other, to trust the process, and to co-create. To let go of control, for me, has been a way to help me bring out the best (in) the people I work with.\n\nAnd to trust that people really want to contribute and not have an idea of exactly what the outcome must be, but rather welcoming what emerges and (to) build on that together rather than judging whether it is right or wrong. If the will is there, the result will be positive. So it's more about creating that atmosphere and trying to formulate a common vision than looking at exactly how things must be done.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** **What would be something that you want to impart to our listeners who would like to integrate the Inner Development Goals in their daily life?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** That's a good one. Like I shared with you, Paulyn, I've been driven by a vision all my career, that we can reach a more sustainable world. But I was starting to lose hope until I came across the IDGs, because I knew there was something missing, but I just didn't know what it was. I was working in leadership development, so I knew it had something to do with people. It's about relationships. It's about what we do together, how we collaborate, how we co-create, how we make things happen.\n\nAnd for me, having something so simple and so accessible that can be integrated in so many different kinds of organizations and circumstances, it gives me hope.\n\nSo why don't we just, you know, join hands and do this? And if we realize that we're having (difficulty) doing it, then we may need to work in our individual capacities. We need the trust and we need the courage, but we can do it.\n\nIt's not too late. It's about time. And I think the world is ready for it.\n\n\\---\n\nInterested in learning more?

emotional intelligence, mindfulness, and resilience. These inner qualities are critical for addressing the complex challenges of our time and for driving meaningful, systemic change towards sustainability. Our discussion withÂ Ãsa Jarskog, the Director Global Collaboration of the Inner Development GoalsÂ will cover the origins, development, and applications of the IDG framework, showcasing how it equips individuals, communities, and organizations with the inner skills needed to effectively contribute to the global sustainable development agenda. Let us unlock the synergy between inner transformation and outer action, illuminating a holistic path to achieving a sustainable future for all.\n\n_\\[What follows is a transcription of the podcast, modified for enhanced web readability.\\]_  \n**Paulyn Duman****:** Welcome to the SDG Learncast with me, Paulyn Duman. In every episode, I bring insightful conversations around the subject of sustainable development and learning, helping us all to achieve a sustainable future.\n\nIn this podcast episode, we will look into the transformative power of the Inner Development Goals, or IDGs, and how they support achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals, or the SDGs.\n\nIn this episode, we will explore how the IDGs complement the SDGs by focusing on the inner dimensions of change, such as self-awareness, emotional intelligence, mindfulness, and resilience. As our guest, we have Ms. Ãsa Jarkskog, who is the director for global collaboration of the Inner Development Goals. Welcome to the SDG Learncast, Ãsa.\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog****:** Thank you, Paulyn. It's wonderful to be here with you today.\n\n**Paulyn Duman: Ãsa, tell us about yourself and how you came to work with the IDGs.**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** I've been working with sustainable development in one way or another since 1990, when I started a career with the UN. When the SDGs were launched, I was very thrilled that finally, we had an agenda that was approved by all countries, and we had common goals and clear indicators on how to reach a more sustainable world, and it felt quite comprehensive. But with time, I think I share this frustration with many people.\n\nI realized that we are not reaching those targets, even though we do have the resources on a global basis, and we do have the technology. Somewhere, we must be doing something wrong. That's when I came across the IDGs and felt that they were the missing link.\n\n**Paulyn Duman: And what is your role within the Inner Development Goals?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** When I joined the IDGs, they were quite big in Sweden. It's a fairly young organization. It was launched three years ago; we just celebrated our third-year anniversary. But having worked myself in 61 different countries, I was approached by the IDGs and asked to bring the framework out to the world and, in particular, to the Global South.\n\nMy response was, \"No, I'm not going to bring something to the Global South, but I can go into a dialogue with people from other backgrounds and see what their take on this framework is. I believe we may need to redefine the framework when we go into that conversation.\"\n\nThat's what's happening now. We are doing a global survey where we are redefining the particular skills that the framework currently presents. I'm from Sweden, and when somebody talks about the SDGs and sustainability in Sweden, they're very much focused on the climate crisis, which is the biggest challenge we have here in Sweden. But in many of the countries I have lived and worked in, poverty, hunger, access to education, access to healthâthose are the big challenges that people are dealing with.\n\nSo what I have done is have this dialogue with many different countries and also co-create a capacity development program where we link the IDGs to the SDGs and see how by integrating inner development, not only on an individual level but also on the organizational level and on a systemic level, (we can see) how that can actually contribute to a more sustainable society.\n\n**Paulyn Duman: What inspired the inception of this IDG framework?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** The people that initiated the research were sharing this frustration about the world not becoming more sustainable, or not at the pace we need, and started to look at what the human capacities are that are necessary to develop in order to reach a more sustainable world. Because if it's not about money or resources, it has to have something to do with the ones that actually created these problems in the first place, which is us, human beings.\n\nThere's a lot of research out there that is pointing in that direction, that if we can develop skills like empathy and compassion, for instance, we would become better equipped at working with sustainability. A number of academic institutions, especially in the Western world but also (in) other parts of the world, did a global survey and started looking at what those human capacities would be.\n\nIt was agreed that let's divide these different capacities, human capacities, into five dimensions, and those dimensions are being (how we relate to ourselves), thinking (that's our cognitive skills), relating (how we relate with other people and the world), collaborating, and the last dimension is acting. Extremely important because all the other ones are important, but if you cannot act upon them, change will not happen.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** What is important for me is that we all want to have this journey towards a more sustainable future. **What do you think are the key inner skills and qualities that the IDGs framework highlights as essential? And how do these foster effective leadership, decision-making, and community engagement?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** Actually, for me, it's very difficult to highlight one or two skills or capacities. It's more important to look at the framework as such and the dimensions, because each of us may have skills that we are confident talking about, for instance, self-awareness, to understand our own motivations and impulses. (Or) critical thinkingâwe are in a world of a lot of fake news, and to be able to determine what is trustworthy is much more important than ever.\n\nI feel that currently, empathy and compassion are extremely important, and empathy and compassion are not very often valued when it comes to people in government ministries or military leaders, but they are extremely important in order to work for a more sustainable world. (Also) communication skills, perseverance in actingâand I think we must not lose hope, so perseverance is also extremely important.\n\nOn a global basis, there is one capacity that I have seen that we are lacking in so many parts of the world, and that is trust. But the good news is that we can improve on all these skills. We can continue to develop as human beings for the rest of our lives.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** At the global scale, what is missing is trust, but this is something that we can work on, what we can build on, we can improve.\n\n**How are the IDGs integrated at the organizational level or at the sectoral level? And what are some of the challenges and breakthroughs that you have surveyed in embedding these inner skills in various sectors committed to the Sustainable Development Goals?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** One of the challenges for the IDGs is to be able to communicate with all sectors of society, with all different stakeholders, not only with individuals in civil society but also with the corporate world, academia, (and) government.\n\nWe also collaborate with the UN, and usually, these groups do not always meet together, so we are trying to speak a language that everybody can relate to. To integrate inner development on an individual level is not easy to start with, but it is much easier than to do it on an organizational level. And eventually, to integrate it on a systemic level, you need to really build trust and collaborate with other stakeholder groups in your society.\n\nIn the educational system, it's been integrated, for instance, in India, in the National Education Policy 2020, that has a key role for developing inner skills. Of course, to have these policies actually implemented all over the schools is something that takes time, but we have seenâand I had the pleasure of hosting a track in our IDG Summit last year in Stockholmâwhere there were some kids on stage that described how they have strengthened themselves through IDG training and, for instance, how the level of bullying has been reduced extremely in their schools.\n\nNaturally, we also need to work on the policy level. We cannot only work with the children. We are working with the OECD; we're collaborating with the OECD, and they have researchers working with the PISA framework in order to highlight which indicators in the PISA framework that can actually support (the) integration of IDGs into schools. There are already some of those indicators in the framework, so it's partly a question of highlighting them. The more we can get that into the educational system, the more that our future leaders will be equipped to operate in the complex world that they are going to lead.\n\nThe first government that was very keen on the IDGs was the government of Costa Rica. And they immediately said that they wanted to integrate this into their policies, into the guidelines for policy development of their country.\n\nBut I'm currently leading a global capacity development program where there are representatives from (the) governments of many other countries: India, Albania, Tunisia, the UK, the Netherlands. I worked with Rwanda and Zambia, and they also participate in these training programs to integrate inner development (into) the operations of their organizations, and eventually into their systems.\n\nIn the corporate (world), it's a bit easier because it was a long time ago when the corporate world understood that culture eats strategy. We have been working with big companies such as Ikea, Spotify, Houdini, Novartis, et cetera. So that is probably the easiest area for us when it comes to introducing Inner Development Goals.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** That is amazing. (It's) interesting, especially now with the emergence of generative AI in the last months. The paradox is really that the most valuable skills of all in the future will be those intrinsically, blatantly human. These are critical thinking, collaboration, communication, (and) creativityâso, out-and-out human collaboration.\n\n(The) IDG framework emphasizes presence, mindfulness, and long-term orientation. People have to go out of their short-term thinking. But given the perceptions that the IDGs might be seen as esoteric or overly sentimental, **how do you address these views and demonstrate the practical relevance and impact of IDGs on achieving sustainable development?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** Thank you, Paulyn. It's a good question, and that was actually my view of the IDGs as well before I unpacked them and somebody helped me to unpack it. As I mentioned to you, the IDGs consist of five dimensions: that's the being, thinking, relating, collaborating, and acting. Now, if you take capacities like mindfulness (and) presence, they are very much in the being dimension.\n\nLong-term orientation is very much in the thinking (dimension). But we should not forget that we have also included skills like co-creation and mobilizationâskills (that) are extremely important. They are in the collaborating dimension. And in the acting (dimension), we have courage, creativity, (and) optimism. So it's about developing in all the different areas. And one thing we do is, to (begin with), look at, am I too much in the acting (dimension)? Maybe I need to sometimes pause and be present and take perspectives. I'm one of those people. I really like to act.\n\nOf course, people who are my opposite, those are the ones I really need to team up with because they are better at reflecting and looking at different perspectives, et cetera. So the framework is not there to promote one way of being but (to look at) how we can complement each other to actually make change happen in this world, to take the worldâthrough the individuals and the organizations and the systemsâthrough this painful but absolutely necessary transformation.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** You mentioned creativity, and this is a really crucial component in overcoming sustainable development challenges. **Can you tell us how the IDGs encourage these qualities in individuals or organizations that are working towards achieving the SDGs, particularly if they're not creative?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** Oh, that's a very good question. I've done a lot of leadership training in many different countries, and I've often had the question posed to me, \"How do I make my organization more innovative?\" And I think my first answer has been, \"What is the trust level in your organization? And how much psychological safety is there in your organization?\" If people feel that they need to perform all the time and they're not allowed to make any mistakes, then of course they're not going to be innovative, because being innovative requires some mistakes along the way. But then as a leader, if you tell other people that they can make mistakes, but you are not willing to make any mistakes yourself because you want to be perfect, then, of course, they are not going to (be innovative). You need to walk the talk.\n\nSo it's very much about being on a journey together and co-creating, and embracing the mistakes that actually take us to innovation. I don't know how much you know about the U theory that has been developed at MIT, but we work very closely with MIT as one of our partners. And I did U Lab myself 10 years ago.\n\nAnd it's very much about not downloading what you already know, but actually sensing the future as it comes to you. And then, we need to use different languages in different kinds of organizations. When we enter a government office, we don't start by meditating with them and (saying), \"What is emerging to you?\"\n\nOn the other hand, we have a beautiful network of hubs, which is not (a) particular format of organization. It's just people that, or organizations or whatever, that want to contribute to the development of the IDG work. And we have 550 hubs all over the world in 95 different countries. And what we try to do when we work with the hubs is really just to enable whatever wants to emerge, and a lot of innovation and creativity is taking place in the hubs and networks.\n\n**Paulyn Duman: What is an insight that you have observed so that people who feel like they're lacking creativity can overcome the fear of committing mistakes and being perfectionists?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** That's difficult to give a formula (for), but I've been running a lot of different capacity development programs throughout the years. And I think my main lesson is that less is more. We just recently had a gathering in Tunisia, and when we arrived there, my colleagues were asking me, \"So where are the PowerPoints and where is the projector?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"No, we didn't take people all the way to Tunisia to show them slides. We can do that online. We are here to get to know each other, to trust the process, and to co-create. To let go of control, for me, has been a way to help me bring out the best (in) the people I work with.\n\nAnd to trust that people really want to contribute and not have an idea of exactly what the outcome must be, but rather welcoming what emerges and (to) build on that together rather than judging whether it is right or wrong. If the will is there, the result will be positive. So it's more about creating that atmosphere and trying to formulate a common vision than looking at exactly how things must be done.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** **What would be something that you want to impart to our listeners who would like to integrate the Inner Development Goals in their daily life?**\n\n**Ãsa Jarkskog:** That's a good one. Like I shared with you, Paulyn, I've been driven by a vision all my career, that we can reach a more sustainable world. But I was starting to lose hope until I came across the IDGs, because I knew there was something missing, but I just didn't know what it was. I was working in leadership development, so I knew it had something to do with people. It's about relationships. It's about what we do together, how we collaborate, how we co-create, how we make things happen.\n\nAnd for me, having something so simple and so accessible that can be integrated in so many different kinds of organizations and circumstances, it gives me hope.\n\nSo why don't we just, you know, join hands and do this? And if we realize that we're having (difficulty) doing it, then we may need to work in our individual capacities. We need the trust and we need the courage, but we can do it.\n\nIt's not too late. It's about time. And I think the world is ready for it.\n\n\\---\n\nInterested in learning more?

The increasing reliance on a narrow selection of cultivated crops due to industrial agriculture is causing a concerning reduction in the genetic diversity of plants. This narrowing pool poses a risk to global food security, making our food supply more vulnerable to pests, diseases, and changing climate conditions.\n\nSeed banks play a crucial role in combating this trend by preserving the genetic diversity of thousands of plant species, including traditional and 'forgotten' crops that are resilient to changing climate conditions and offer nutritional benefits. These facilities, alongside innovative agricultural practices, are vital in reintroducing a diversity of crops into modern agriculture. This diversification can lead to more resilient food systems that are capable of withstanding environmental stresses, thereby securing the nutritional needs of future generations.\n\nIn this SDG Learncast episode, we're honored to have Dr. Stefan Schmitz, Executive Director of the [Crop Trust](https://www.croptrust.org/)\n, as our distinguished guest. Dr. Schmitz brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in the fields of agricultural biodiversity and food security. He discussed the growing importance of seed banks in the fight against the erosion of agricultural biodiversity and shared insights into the Crop Trust's efforts to conserve crop diversity globally. This includes supporting key seed banks worldwide and coordinating projects like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, aimed at ensuring the long-term preservation and availability of crop diversity for the benefit of everyone.\n\nDr. Schmitz unpacked the challenges and opportunities in preserving agricultural biodiversity, the critical role of seed banks, and the transformative potential of reintroducing 'forgotten' crops into agriculture. He also highlighted the innovative strategies being employed to support the work of seed banks and the importance of global collaboration in safeguarding our agricultural heritage.Â \n\n  \nThrough this conversation, listeners will gain a deeper understanding of how preserving seed diversity and embracing innovative agricultural practices are essential steps toward a sustainable and food-secure future.\n\n_\\[What follows is a transcription of the podcast, modified for enhanced web readability.\\]_  \n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Welcome to the SDG Learncast with me, Paulyn Duman. In every episode, I bring insightful conversations around the subject of sustainable development and learning, helping us all to achieve a sustainable future.\n\nThe world's food security is increasingly at risk as climate change threatens a growing population and industrial agriculture's focus on a few crops reduces plant genetic diversity.\n\nThis reduction heightens vulnerability to pests, diseases, and climate shifts. Seed banks are essential in countering this trend by preserving the genetic diversity of numerous plant species, including traditional and quote unquote, forgotten crops that adapt well to environmental changes and provide nutritional benefits.\n\nBy supporting the reintroduction of diverse crops into agriculture, seed banks and innovative farming practices are key to developing resilient food systems that can meet future nutritional demands.\n\nIn this SDG Learncast episode, we are honored to have Dr. Stefan Schmitz, the Executive Director of CropTrust, as our distinguished guest.\n\nDr. Schmitz brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in the fields of agricultural biodiversity and food security.\n\nWelcome to the SDG Learncast, Dr. Schmitz.\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Great pleasure. Thank you very much.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Dr. Schmitz, **can you tell us about yourself and your work at** **CropTrust?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Since the year 2020, I'm now the Executive Director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, or Crop Trust for short.\n\nWe are based in Bonn, in Germany. We are an international organization operating under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Before joining the Crop Trust in 2020, I've been with the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, BMZ, for 20 years, and they are leading the work on food, agriculture and rural resources.\n\nThe Crop Trust has been established 20 years ago, and its mission is to build a global system of seed banks around the world. The Crop Trust provides financial and technical support for seed banks around the world, for those seed banks who are in need of support.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** I'm really curious to hear about this. **What are seed banks and how do they serve as a crucial defense against the erosion of agricultural biodiversity? Tell us what challenges do seed banks face, especially in poorer countries?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Man, when about 12, 000 years ago entered into agriculture, since that time created hundreds, thousands of different varieties of wheat, maize rice, potatoes, and all kinds of crops. Imagine there are today we know more than 100,000 varieties of rice, more than 100,000 varieties of wheat, more than 20,000 varieties of maize all around the world that have been created during the last 12,000 years.\n\nThis diversity is extremely important. All these different varieties are adapted to certain environments, to certain climates, to certain soils, to certain pests and diseases. Every variety is able to deal with biotic and abiotic stress and breeders always, they did it in the past and do it today.\n\nThey create new varieties by breeding out of the existing. And so, winning constantly again this race against time, when it comes to adapting to new environmental and other challenges. This diversity is a life insurance for survival of mankind is the means to provide food that is adapted to changing environments.\n\nHowever, during the last fifty hundred years a lot of this diversity is disappearing or has been disappeared from the fields. It made way to pave the way to a more uniform, standardized set of only a few crops, only a few hybrid varieties. This had a lot of advantages. It helped to develop agriculture. It helped many countries on their way out of hunger and poverty. However, the flip side of it, the diversity disappears from the field, but we still need it, we still depend on it. And the more diversity disappears from the fields, The more important it is that we keep this diversity secured, conserved in seed banks, so that from there they can be repatriated to the fields and can be brought to breeding and to research.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** That's important to know that the seed banks are making sure that we preserve the diversity of crops, the diversity of seeds and that in the future we will have access to all of these crops. **Can you provide us with some examples of these challenges that the seed banks are facing**, **especially in poorer countries?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:**Â Let me start by mentioning that there are more than 1,700 seed banks around the world. More than 1,700 are registered at the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, the FAO in Rome. We regard about 100 to 200 of those as important. The bigger ones with more than 10, 000 as we say, accessions or seed samples each.\n\nThat's only, let's say, the tip of the iceberg. Not to say that we disregard the rest, but just to give a feeling of how many we are and how many are important in particular in many countries of the South and many countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia those gene banks, those seed banks are terribly underfunded.\n\nThey are far from being close to international standards. Often, their cooling system is not properly working. In many cases, the staff is not sufficiently trained. There are no proper documentation services, no capacities for viability tests for safety, duplication of the seeds and all of that.\n\nAgainst this background, the Crop Trust was established exactly 20 years ago, to support those suffering gene banks in the global South. As I said before, we provide financial support, but we also provide technical know-how. We train staff, we support in building information systems and all of that to make sure that all those seeds are really conserved in perpetuity.\n\nAnd that's the same time the seeds are available for use for farmers, for breeders, for researchers, and this becoming more and more important in times of climate change where there is a constant search for new varieties that are able to withstand longer droughts higher temperatures, severe flooding, and other kinds of events.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** I'm really curious to hear about the forgotten crops, but also the opportunity crops. Some crops are very important when it comes to climate resilience. **Can you discuss the importance of the forgotten and opportunity** crops. How are they transforming agriculture for climate resilience?\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Biologists estimate that there are more than 32,000 varieties of plants that in theory are edible, are ready for human consumption. About 200, 300 of them have real potential, but when looking at realities on the market at statistics, mankind heavily depends on four, five or six crops, mainly wheat, rice, maize, potatoes soy and the like. There are at least 100 more that had been, let's say, neglected by research and breeding over the last hundred years. There has been a tremendous focus on these main staple crops.\n\nAnd no wonder that there is enough hybrid wheat around the world that is able to feed the world. But this is very risky. We cannot rely on only those few crops. There are many other neglected, underutilized crops, or how we today sometimes like to coin them, opportunity crops. There are great opportunities.\n\nLet's take Millets as an example. Millets played a role in parts of the world many years ago. It still plays a role in some regions or on a local basis. But millets are little wonders. We could use them far better. They are far more stress tolerant when it comes to high temperatures or droughts compared to wheat, for example.\n\nThey contain lots of micronutrients. They are healthy. And they have other advantages. And this is only one example. There are many others, Sorghum, Yam, Tef, Phonio, Alfafa, and so on. At least we take it that in Africa alone there are a hundred so-called neglected and underutilized crops.\n\nThey never will be able to conquer the global market. However, it is good investment in doing more in collecting them from the wild, bring them to seed banks and make them also available for research and for breeding. Many of them have great potential and we will use them. We need to prepare all the time for new pests, for new diseases, for changing situations, and broader, the base of our nutrition of our diet.\n\nOld economic wisdom tells us, don't put all your eggs in one basket. But this is exactly what we are currently doing in our global agriculture and food systems. We rely on only a few crops, and we should overcome this to make sure that we are able to survive uncertain futures.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** I can imagine that there will be noone who would be against introducing or reintegrating crops that are more climate resilient that are, more nutritious, like what you have just mentioned. **What are these barriers in reintegrating these crops again into our agricultural system? What is the problem in reintroducing them again?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** The main problem here is that market forces bring demand and supply together in a way that is in a long-term disadvantage. The more markets are focusing on only a few crops and enter into mass production of only a few crops, the cheaper, the more affordable are only those few crops. And the more long- term demand from consumers will focus on those crops. And the more the demand from consumers focuses on those crops, the more the supply again reacts to it. We are in a vicious cycle, and we need to break this one. But if we have the choice, either we do this now well in advance of an upcoming catastrophe or we wait till the catastrophe comes and then all of sudden markets have to change. Yeah, so, the sooner we are able to steer the entire development and give political incentives to, for example, doing more research into neglected crops, the better for the future of world food supply.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** We need to act now. We need to reintroduce crops, but I feel like there is much that market demands, and agricultural policies are affecting the diversity of crops. In what way are these also affecting small farmers. **Can you** **provide some examples?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** What we discuss here, bringing neglected crops back to the market is in particular in the interest of smallholder agriculture. Bringing crops to the market could bring new opportunities for small holders, for the local, and for the regional economy.\n\nLet me give some examples. Rice usually is regarded as a globalized crop. However, there are specific varieties in Africa rice crops that are neglected. Currently, the African rice market is dominated by import from Southeast Asia. So, bringing old Africa rice varieties into the Africa market, support smallholder agriculture, that would be a win for everybody.\n\nIt would be a win for the planet, for the diversity, it would reduce transport, it would substitute outdated rice far beyond the best before date, which has lost all the nutrients by fresh products. It would add to healthy diets of people. It would help the small holders in Africa, it would help the African countries with their trade balance.\n\nSo in the end, you would see only winners. But it takes political will to invest in those neglected and underutilized Africa rice varieties. There needs to be a focus on research, on national agriculture policy, and on development policy, international cooperation as well.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** This also reminds me of my father who belongs to a family of farmers. He grew up in Batangas, Philippines there are big farms growing crops, but people are importing rice, and we don't have money to pay for the food and we're not growing them ourselves. The question for me is, **how can we ensure investment in these programs and is there in any way technology can be** **leveraged as well to advance the breeding programs?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Modern technologies now give great opportunities, and we should use them. That starts with usually using artificial intelligence when building information systems and making sure that all breeders, all researchers on earth know where they can find in what seed bank around the world, they can find what varieties with what properties, genetic traits and all.\n\nThere are modern breeding technologies, with artificial intelligence and data mining and using all of those tools that are available today and that could be used in bringing neglected and underutilized crops back to the market at low-cost level, but it requires a political attention.\n\nIt requires political decision makers all around the world to understand and acknowledge the advantages of building a sustainable, productive, own national agriculture based on local and regional resources. That. is a prerequisite for bringing those neglected and underutilized crops.\n\nLocal solutions by using global diversity, I would say, this is one of the key concerns and that should be the compass of the direction. We could save so much money, we have so many opportunities to improve the livelihoods of farmers, to improve the diets of people by making diversity more available.\n\nOr let's put it the other way around. Diversity ticks so many developmental boxes. It starts with diversity, using it for breeding purposes and making new crop varieties more resilient to climate change. Breeding new varieties that are less demanding on water on fertilizers on soil quality.\n\nI already mentioned Millets as one example here. We are able to breed varieties today, which are less perishable, which are better for long term storage. With that, you can easily reduce post-harvest losses, which adds a lot to greenhouse gas emissions out of the agriculture and food system.\n\nWe currently estimate that one third of all the food that is produced does not end up on the consumer's plate. Diversity you can use in all kinds of agroforestry systems. Diversity of plants, shrubs and trees you can use in landscape restoration, in soil rehabilitation, in landscape improvement and the like.\n\nAs mentioned before, diversity provides smallholder farmers with more economic opportunities. They can improve their livelihood. And last but not least, using diversity is the most important prerequisite for fighting hunger, for fighting malnutrition. Given the fact that there are more than 2 billion people on earth suffering micronutrient deficiency, suffering hidden hunger.\n\nThere are great opportunities by simply making diversity of not just cereals, but in particular fruits, legumes, nuts, and all kinds of crops more available to, in particular to poor parts of the population.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** One of the key messages that I got from this discussion is that it's important for world leaders to have the political will to ensure that the investments in these breeding programs that the forgotten crops are actually prioritized, especially because they are more nutritious, more climate resilient.\n\nOne of the things that I read from an earlier article from the Guardian this year was about corporations that want to patent seeds, which is also one of the issues because some farmers are afraid of legal litigation from planting some patented seeds.\n\nMy question is not so much about the legal aspect, but **how can a work of nature be claimed by corporations, what is your opinion about this? And what is the role of Crop Trust in this context?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** There are market forces towards building monopolies, which I don't regard as advantages and positive for securing global food supply and fighting hunger. I'm convinced that the more we all invest in diversity, and the more we invest in revitalization of all those old varieties, and creating something new out of this heritage, the more we do this, the more the global food systems will be independent, will be really food sovereign.\n\nWe'll be independent from monopolies, from those kinds of trends which are not healthy for people and for the planet. And again, this requires political will in Each and every country and perhaps above all global cooperation, global common understanding. With the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, we have an excellent instrument at hand.\n\nWe need to make the best out of it. Make sure that all those seed banks in the world cooperate closer together. This is one of the activities now the Crop Trust is focusing on each and every seed bank matters, but beyond that, the system of all seed banks is more than the sum of its part.\n\nWe want to see a global system of seed banks rising that is efficient, effective, and playing a crucial role in building a productive agriculture in countries and productive agriculture and food systems.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** This is the seed savers crusade to work together and collaborate to make sure that we preserve the seeds, which are the insurance for the biodiversity of the future. I'm sure that we have listeners who are interested in the work of Crop Trust. **If there are listeners who are curious to learn more about your work and your research and how they can help you or maybe participate in some of your activities what would you tell them?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Please first check our website [www.croptrust.org](https://euc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/www.croptrust.org)\n. You will find all the information and please come to us, and we would be more than happy to answer more specific questions you might have.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Thank you so much. And to our listeners who are interested in seeds in plants and crops, if you love food, this episode is something for you too. Thank you so much, Dr. Schmitz.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n_Paulyn Duman is the Knowledge Management, Communications, and Reporting Officer at the United Nations System Staff College (UNSSC) Knowledge Centre for Sustainable Development and is a coordinator for the Joint Secretariat of UN SDG:Learn, together with UNITAR._\n\n_The opinions expressed in the SDG Learncast podcasts are solely those of the authors.

The increasing reliance on a narrow selection of cultivated crops due to industrial agriculture is causing a concerning reduction in the genetic diversity of plants. This narrowing pool poses a risk to global food security, making our food supply more vulnerable to pests, diseases, and changing climate conditions.\n\nSeed banks play a crucial role in combating this trend by preserving the genetic diversity of thousands of plant species, including traditional and 'forgotten' crops that are resilient to changing climate conditions and offer nutritional benefits. These facilities, alongside innovative agricultural practices, are vital in reintroducing a diversity of crops into modern agriculture. This diversification can lead to more resilient food systems that are capable of withstanding environmental stresses, thereby securing the nutritional needs of future generations.\n\nIn this SDG Learncast episode, we're honored to have Dr. Stefan Schmitz, Executive Director of the [Crop Trust](https://www.croptrust.org/)\n, as our distinguished guest. Dr. Schmitz brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in the fields of agricultural biodiversity and food security. He discussed the growing importance of seed banks in the fight against the erosion of agricultural biodiversity and shared insights into the Crop Trust's efforts to conserve crop diversity globally. This includes supporting key seed banks worldwide and coordinating projects like the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, aimed at ensuring the long-term preservation and availability of crop diversity for the benefit of everyone.\n\nDr. Schmitz unpacked the challenges and opportunities in preserving agricultural biodiversity, the critical role of seed banks, and the transformative potential of reintroducing 'forgotten' crops into agriculture. He also highlighted the innovative strategies being employed to support the work of seed banks and the importance of global collaboration in safeguarding our agricultural heritage.Â \n\n  \nThrough this conversation, listeners will gain a deeper understanding of how preserving seed diversity and embracing innovative agricultural practices are essential steps toward a sustainable and food-secure future.\n\n_\\[What follows is a transcription of the podcast, modified for enhanced web readability.\\]_  \n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Welcome to the SDG Learncast with me, Paulyn Duman. In every episode, I bring insightful conversations around the subject of sustainable development and learning, helping us all to achieve a sustainable future.\n\nThe world's food security is increasingly at risk as climate change threatens a growing population and industrial agriculture's focus on a few crops reduces plant genetic diversity.\n\nThis reduction heightens vulnerability to pests, diseases, and climate shifts. Seed banks are essential in countering this trend by preserving the genetic diversity of numerous plant species, including traditional and quote unquote, forgotten crops that adapt well to environmental changes and provide nutritional benefits.\n\nBy supporting the reintroduction of diverse crops into agriculture, seed banks and innovative farming practices are key to developing resilient food systems that can meet future nutritional demands.\n\nIn this SDG Learncast episode, we are honored to have Dr. Stefan Schmitz, the Executive Director of CropTrust, as our distinguished guest.\n\nDr. Schmitz brings a wealth of knowledge and experience in the fields of agricultural biodiversity and food security.\n\nWelcome to the SDG Learncast, Dr. Schmitz.\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Great pleasure. Thank you very much.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Dr. Schmitz, **can you tell us about yourself and your work at** **CropTrust?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Since the year 2020, I'm now the Executive Director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, or Crop Trust for short.\n\nWe are based in Bonn, in Germany. We are an international organization operating under the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Before joining the Crop Trust in 2020, I've been with the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, BMZ, for 20 years, and they are leading the work on food, agriculture and rural resources.\n\nThe Crop Trust has been established 20 years ago, and its mission is to build a global system of seed banks around the world. The Crop Trust provides financial and technical support for seed banks around the world, for those seed banks who are in need of support.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** I'm really curious to hear about this. **What are seed banks and how do they serve as a crucial defense against the erosion of agricultural biodiversity? Tell us what challenges do seed banks face, especially in poorer countries?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Man, when about 12, 000 years ago entered into agriculture, since that time created hundreds, thousands of different varieties of wheat, maize rice, potatoes, and all kinds of crops. Imagine there are today we know more than 100,000 varieties of rice, more than 100,000 varieties of wheat, more than 20,000 varieties of maize all around the world that have been created during the last 12,000 years.\n\nThis diversity is extremely important. All these different varieties are adapted to certain environments, to certain climates, to certain soils, to certain pests and diseases. Every variety is able to deal with biotic and abiotic stress and breeders always, they did it in the past and do it today.\n\nThey create new varieties by breeding out of the existing. And so, winning constantly again this race against time, when it comes to adapting to new environmental and other challenges. This diversity is a life insurance for survival of mankind is the means to provide food that is adapted to changing environments.\n\nHowever, during the last fifty hundred years a lot of this diversity is disappearing or has been disappeared from the fields. It made way to pave the way to a more uniform, standardized set of only a few crops, only a few hybrid varieties. This had a lot of advantages. It helped to develop agriculture. It helped many countries on their way out of hunger and poverty. However, the flip side of it, the diversity disappears from the field, but we still need it, we still depend on it. And the more diversity disappears from the fields, The more important it is that we keep this diversity secured, conserved in seed banks, so that from there they can be repatriated to the fields and can be brought to breeding and to research.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** That's important to know that the seed banks are making sure that we preserve the diversity of crops, the diversity of seeds and that in the future we will have access to all of these crops. **Can you provide us with some examples of these challenges that the seed banks are facing**, **especially in poorer countries?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:**Â Let me start by mentioning that there are more than 1,700 seed banks around the world. More than 1,700 are registered at the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, the FAO in Rome. We regard about 100 to 200 of those as important. The bigger ones with more than 10, 000 as we say, accessions or seed samples each.\n\nThat's only, let's say, the tip of the iceberg. Not to say that we disregard the rest, but just to give a feeling of how many we are and how many are important in particular in many countries of the South and many countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia those gene banks, those seed banks are terribly underfunded.\n\nThey are far from being close to international standards. Often, their cooling system is not properly working. In many cases, the staff is not sufficiently trained. There are no proper documentation services, no capacities for viability tests for safety, duplication of the seeds and all of that.\n\nAgainst this background, the Crop Trust was established exactly 20 years ago, to support those suffering gene banks in the global South. As I said before, we provide financial support, but we also provide technical know-how. We train staff, we support in building information systems and all of that to make sure that all those seeds are really conserved in perpetuity.\n\nAnd that's the same time the seeds are available for use for farmers, for breeders, for researchers, and this becoming more and more important in times of climate change where there is a constant search for new varieties that are able to withstand longer droughts higher temperatures, severe flooding, and other kinds of events.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** I'm really curious to hear about the forgotten crops, but also the opportunity crops. Some crops are very important when it comes to climate resilience. **Can you discuss the importance of the forgotten and opportunity** crops. How are they transforming agriculture for climate resilience?\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Biologists estimate that there are more than 32,000 varieties of plants that in theory are edible, are ready for human consumption. About 200, 300 of them have real potential, but when looking at realities on the market at statistics, mankind heavily depends on four, five or six crops, mainly wheat, rice, maize, potatoes soy and the like. There are at least 100 more that had been, let's say, neglected by research and breeding over the last hundred years. There has been a tremendous focus on these main staple crops.\n\nAnd no wonder that there is enough hybrid wheat around the world that is able to feed the world. But this is very risky. We cannot rely on only those few crops. There are many other neglected, underutilized crops, or how we today sometimes like to coin them, opportunity crops. There are great opportunities.\n\nLet's take Millets as an example. Millets played a role in parts of the world many years ago. It still plays a role in some regions or on a local basis. But millets are little wonders. We could use them far better. They are far more stress tolerant when it comes to high temperatures or droughts compared to wheat, for example.\n\nThey contain lots of micronutrients. They are healthy. And they have other advantages. And this is only one example. There are many others, Sorghum, Yam, Tef, Phonio, Alfafa, and so on. At least we take it that in Africa alone there are a hundred so-called neglected and underutilized crops.\n\nThey never will be able to conquer the global market. However, it is good investment in doing more in collecting them from the wild, bring them to seed banks and make them also available for research and for breeding. Many of them have great potential and we will use them. We need to prepare all the time for new pests, for new diseases, for changing situations, and broader, the base of our nutrition of our diet.\n\nOld economic wisdom tells us, don't put all your eggs in one basket. But this is exactly what we are currently doing in our global agriculture and food systems. We rely on only a few crops, and we should overcome this to make sure that we are able to survive uncertain futures.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** I can imagine that there will be noone who would be against introducing or reintegrating crops that are more climate resilient that are, more nutritious, like what you have just mentioned. **What are these barriers in reintegrating these crops again into our agricultural system? What is the problem in reintroducing them again?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** The main problem here is that market forces bring demand and supply together in a way that is in a long-term disadvantage. The more markets are focusing on only a few crops and enter into mass production of only a few crops, the cheaper, the more affordable are only those few crops. And the more long- term demand from consumers will focus on those crops. And the more the demand from consumers focuses on those crops, the more the supply again reacts to it. We are in a vicious cycle, and we need to break this one. But if we have the choice, either we do this now well in advance of an upcoming catastrophe or we wait till the catastrophe comes and then all of sudden markets have to change. Yeah, so, the sooner we are able to steer the entire development and give political incentives to, for example, doing more research into neglected crops, the better for the future of world food supply.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** We need to act now. We need to reintroduce crops, but I feel like there is much that market demands, and agricultural policies are affecting the diversity of crops. In what way are these also affecting small farmers. **Can you** **provide some examples?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** What we discuss here, bringing neglected crops back to the market is in particular in the interest of smallholder agriculture. Bringing crops to the market could bring new opportunities for small holders, for the local, and for the regional economy.\n\nLet me give some examples. Rice usually is regarded as a globalized crop. However, there are specific varieties in Africa rice crops that are neglected. Currently, the African rice market is dominated by import from Southeast Asia. So, bringing old Africa rice varieties into the Africa market, support smallholder agriculture, that would be a win for everybody.\n\nIt would be a win for the planet, for the diversity, it would reduce transport, it would substitute outdated rice far beyond the best before date, which has lost all the nutrients by fresh products. It would add to healthy diets of people. It would help the small holders in Africa, it would help the African countries with their trade balance.\n\nSo in the end, you would see only winners. But it takes political will to invest in those neglected and underutilized Africa rice varieties. There needs to be a focus on research, on national agriculture policy, and on development policy, international cooperation as well.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** This also reminds me of my father who belongs to a family of farmers. He grew up in Batangas, Philippines there are big farms growing crops, but people are importing rice, and we don't have money to pay for the food and we're not growing them ourselves. The question for me is, **how can we ensure investment in these programs and is there in any way technology can be** **leveraged as well to advance the breeding programs?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Modern technologies now give great opportunities, and we should use them. That starts with usually using artificial intelligence when building information systems and making sure that all breeders, all researchers on earth know where they can find in what seed bank around the world, they can find what varieties with what properties, genetic traits and all.\n\nThere are modern breeding technologies, with artificial intelligence and data mining and using all of those tools that are available today and that could be used in bringing neglected and underutilized crops back to the market at low-cost level, but it requires a political attention.\n\nIt requires political decision makers all around the world to understand and acknowledge the advantages of building a sustainable, productive, own national agriculture based on local and regional resources. That. is a prerequisite for bringing those neglected and underutilized crops.\n\nLocal solutions by using global diversity, I would say, this is one of the key concerns and that should be the compass of the direction. We could save so much money, we have so many opportunities to improve the livelihoods of farmers, to improve the diets of people by making diversity more available.\n\nOr let's put it the other way around. Diversity ticks so many developmental boxes. It starts with diversity, using it for breeding purposes and making new crop varieties more resilient to climate change. Breeding new varieties that are less demanding on water on fertilizers on soil quality.\n\nI already mentioned Millets as one example here. We are able to breed varieties today, which are less perishable, which are better for long term storage. With that, you can easily reduce post-harvest losses, which adds a lot to greenhouse gas emissions out of the agriculture and food system.\n\nWe currently estimate that one third of all the food that is produced does not end up on the consumer's plate. Diversity you can use in all kinds of agroforestry systems. Diversity of plants, shrubs and trees you can use in landscape restoration, in soil rehabilitation, in landscape improvement and the like.\n\nAs mentioned before, diversity provides smallholder farmers with more economic opportunities. They can improve their livelihood. And last but not least, using diversity is the most important prerequisite for fighting hunger, for fighting malnutrition. Given the fact that there are more than 2 billion people on earth suffering micronutrient deficiency, suffering hidden hunger.\n\nThere are great opportunities by simply making diversity of not just cereals, but in particular fruits, legumes, nuts, and all kinds of crops more available to, in particular to poor parts of the population.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** One of the key messages that I got from this discussion is that it's important for world leaders to have the political will to ensure that the investments in these breeding programs that the forgotten crops are actually prioritized, especially because they are more nutritious, more climate resilient.\n\nOne of the things that I read from an earlier article from the Guardian this year was about corporations that want to patent seeds, which is also one of the issues because some farmers are afraid of legal litigation from planting some patented seeds.\n\nMy question is not so much about the legal aspect, but **how can a work of nature be claimed by corporations, what is your opinion about this? And what is the role of Crop Trust in this context?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** There are market forces towards building monopolies, which I don't regard as advantages and positive for securing global food supply and fighting hunger. I'm convinced that the more we all invest in diversity, and the more we invest in revitalization of all those old varieties, and creating something new out of this heritage, the more we do this, the more the global food systems will be independent, will be really food sovereign.\n\nWe'll be independent from monopolies, from those kinds of trends which are not healthy for people and for the planet. And again, this requires political will in Each and every country and perhaps above all global cooperation, global common understanding. With the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, we have an excellent instrument at hand.\n\nWe need to make the best out of it. Make sure that all those seed banks in the world cooperate closer together. This is one of the activities now the Crop Trust is focusing on each and every seed bank matters, but beyond that, the system of all seed banks is more than the sum of its part.\n\nWe want to see a global system of seed banks rising that is efficient, effective, and playing a crucial role in building a productive agriculture in countries and productive agriculture and food systems.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** This is the seed savers crusade to work together and collaborate to make sure that we preserve the seeds, which are the insurance for the biodiversity of the future. I'm sure that we have listeners who are interested in the work of Crop Trust. **If there are listeners who are curious to learn more about your work and your research and how they can help you or maybe participate in some of your activities what would you tell them?**\n\n**Stefan Schmitz:** Please first check our website [www.croptrust.org](https://euc-word-edit.officeapps.live.com/we/www.croptrust.org)\n. You will find all the information and please come to us, and we would be more than happy to answer more specific questions you might have.\n\n**Paulyn Duman:** Thank you so much. And to our listeners who are interested in seeds in plants and crops, if you love food, this episode is something for you too. Thank you so much, Dr. Schmitz.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n_Paulyn Duman is the Knowledge Management, Communications, and Reporting Officer at the United Nations System Staff College (UNSSC) Knowledge Centre for Sustainable Development and is a coordinator for the Joint Secretariat of UN SDG:Learn, together with UNITAR._\n\n_The opinions expressed in the SDG Learncast podcasts are solely those of the authors.
